(CNN)It's
been
two
weeks
since
Donald
Trump's
inauguration,
and
the
new
President's
work
so
far
hasn't
impressed
the
American
people.A
majority,
53%,
disapprove
of
the
way
the
President
is
handling
his
job,
according
to
a
new
CNN/ORC
poll,
marking
the
highest
disapproval
for
a
new
elected
president
since
polls
began
tracking
those
results.
Trump
is
the
only
President
to
hold
a
net-negative
rating
this
early
in
his
tenure.
Read
the
poll
results
Overall,
44%
approve
of
the
way
he's
handling
the
job,
seven
points
below
the
previous
low-point
of
51%.
Further,
the
share
who
disapprove
"strongly"
of
Trump's
work
as
president
is
nearly
as
large
as
the
total
block
who
approve,
43%
feel
intensely
negative
about
Trump.
Partisanship
is
the
sharpest
divider
in
opinions
on
Trump
(90%
of
Republicans
approve
vs.
10%
of
Democrats).
Trump's
high
disapproval
most
clearly
differentiates
his
ratings
from
those
of
his
predecessors.
While
Ronald
Reagan's
first
approval
rating
measure
of
51%
from
Gallup
in
1981
was
not
that
far
above
Trump's
44%
now,
Reagan's
disapproval
number
was
far
lower
than
Trump's
(13%
to
53%).
And
George
W.
Bush,
the
last
president
to
be
elected
without
capturing
the
popular
vote,
held
a
far
more
positive
57%
overall
approval
rating
in
February
of
his
first
year
in
office,
with
just
25%
disapproving.
Several
specific
actions
Trump
has
taken
in
his
first
two
weeks
are
also
meeting
with
majority
opposition,
according
to
the
poll.
Most
oppose
the
travel
restrictions
put
in
place
by
executive
order
last
week,
and
55%
say
they
see
it
as
an
attempt
to
ban
Muslims
from
entering
the
US.
Further,
6
in
10
oppose
Trump's
plan
to
build
a
wall
along
the
border
with
Mexico.
Overall,
47%
say
they
favor
the
executive
order
on
travel,
which
prohibits
entry
to
the
US
for
90
days
by
citizens
of
seven
majority-Muslim
countries
while
suspending
the
US
refugee
program
for
120
days
and
reducing
the
total
number
of
refugees
the
US
will
accept
this
year.
A
majority,
53%,
say
they
oppose
the
order.
Those
who
favor
the
ban
say
by
a
2-to-1
margin
that
they
would
like
to
see
it
expanded
to
other
countries.
Opposition
to
the
travel
ban
rests
somewhat
on
perceptions
that
it
fulfills
one
of
Trump's
campaign
proposals:
A
ban
on
entry
for
Muslims.
The
perception
that
the
executive
order
is
an
attempt
to
ban
Muslims
from
entering
is
driven
largely
by
opponents
of
the
order
--
82%
of
whom
see
it
as
a
Muslim
ban,
though
a
quarter
of
those
who
support
it
also
see
it
as
an
attempt
to
ban
Muslims
from
entering
the
country
(25%
say
so).
The
public
is
more
closely
divided
on
whether
the
order
makes
the
US
safer
or
protects
American
values,
two
arguments
the
Trump
administration
has
put
forth
in
support
of
the
order.
About
4
in
10
(41%)
agree
with
the
Trump
administration's
contention
that
the
ban
makes
the
US
safer
from
terrorism,
while
more
(46%)
say
it
makes
the
US
less
safe
from
terrorism
and
another
12%
say
it
doesn't
make
a
difference.
Further,
just
about
half
(49%)
think
the
order
harms
American
values
by
keeping
out
people
who
are
seeking
asylum,
while
43%
say
it
does
more
to
protect
American
values
by
keeping
out
people
who
don't
support
those
values.
Across
all
these
questions,
opinions
are
sharply
divided
by
party.
Democrats
are
just
as
apt
to
oppose
the
executive
order
(88%)
as
Republicans
are
to
support
it
(88%);
independents
tilt
against,
with
54%
opposed.
Republicans
are
10
times
as
likely
as
Democrats
to
say
the
order
makes
the
US
safer
(83%
of
Republicans
vs.
8%
of
Democrats),
and
their
opinions
are
again
180
degrees
apart
when
asked
about
its
impact
on
American
values
(80%
of
Republicans
say
it
protects
them
while
81%
of
Democrats
say
it
harms
them).
There
is
also
a
sharp
partisan
divide
on
whether
America
should
accept
Syrian
refugees
generally,
with
73%
of
Democrats
in
favor
compared
with
just
30%
of
Republicans.
Support
for
accepting
refugees
has
risen
across
partisan
divides
since
late
2015,
however,
from
38%
support
in
late
2015
to
54%
now,
including
13-point
increases
in
support
among
both
Democrats
and
Republicans.
Considering
another
executive
order
from
the
first
days
of
the
Trump
presidency,
Americans
remain
largely
opposed
to
building
a
wall
along
the
entire
border
with
Mexico.
In
September,
41%
favored
that;
38%
do
so
now.
Opposition
to
the
construction
of
a
border
wall
now
stands
at
60%.
Trump
ordered
immediate
construction
of
the
wall
through
an
executive
order
signed
less
than
a
week
after
taking
office,
but
the
order
does
not
address
funding
for
the
wall.
Those
in
favor
of
building
it
support
the
Trump
administration's
proposal
to
fund
it
through
import
taxes
on
goods
imported
from
Mexico
by
a
wide
margin.
Assessing
Trump's
work
on
a
range
of
issues
so
far,
majorities
disapprove
of
Trump's
handling
of
immigration
(56%),
foreign
affairs
(55%)
and
terrorism
(53%).
Half
(50%)
disapprove
of
his
handling
of
health
care
policy
as
he
seeks
to
roll
back
the
provisions
of
Obamacare,
while
42%
approve
of
his
work
on
health
care.
Americans
are
split,
49%
approve
to
46%
disapprove,
on
his
handling
of
national
security.
The
economy
remains
Trump's
bright
spot,
with
49%
approving
vs.
43%
disapproving.
A
broad
majority,
78%,
say
the
way
Trump
has
handled
the
presidency
so
far
is
how
they
expected
him
to,
with
just
21%
saying
the
way
he's
handling
the
job
is
unexpected.
Still,
those
who
have
been
surprised
by
his
work
don't
see
it
as
a
pleasant
one:
17%
say
it's
been
a
bad
thing
vs.
3%
who
say
he's
performed
unexpectedly
well.
The
CNN/ORC
poll
was
conducted
by
telephone
January
31
through
February
2
among
a
random
national
sample
of
1,002
adults.
Results
for
the
full
sample
have
a
margin
of
error
of
plus
or
minus
three
percentage
points,
it
is
larger
for
subgroups.
