(CNN)An
Arizona
trooper
who
had
been
shot
and
was
being
beaten
by
a
man
with
a
pistol
was
saved
Thursday
by
a
motorist
who
killed
his
attacker,
authorities
said.Thanks
for
the
thoughts
and
prayers
this
morning
for
our
Trooper
that
was
shot.
Looks
like
he
will
be
okay
after
some
recovery

this
report.
The
man
who
came
upon
the
scene
warned
the
suspect
to
stop
striking
the
officer,
but
the
assailant
continued,
said
Capt.
Damon
Cecil,
a
spokesman
for
the
Arizona
Department
of
Public
Safety.
The
good
Samaritan
got
a
gun
from
his
car
and
shot
the
suspect,
who
died
at
the
scene.
The
trooper,
a
27-year
veteran,
was
shot
in
the
chest
and
shoulder.
He
is
in
serious
and
stable
condition,
Cecil
said.
The
trooper
was
identified
Friday
as
Ed
Andersson.
Col.
Frank
Milstead,
director
of
the
Public
Safety
Department,
said
he
would
like
to
thank
the
man
who
stepped
in.
"I
don't
know
that
my
trooper
would
be
alive
today
without
his
assistance,"
he
said,
according
to
CNN
affiliate
KNXV-TV
in
Phoenix.
Unusual
circumstances
Public
safety
spokesman
Bart
Graves
said
the
incident
began
with
the
trooper
responding
to
report
of
shots
fired
from
the
median
of
an
unlit,
rural
section
of
Interstate
10
near
Tonopah.
Andersson
came
across
a
vehicle
that
had
rolled
over
and
got
out
to
investigate.
While
Andersson
was
setting
flares,
the
suspect
shot
him.
It
was
not
clear
where
the
suspect
was
when
the
officer
pulled
up.
Milstead
said
at
some
point
the
suspect
started
beating
Andersson,
who
was
unable
to
use
his
right
arm
to
defend
himself.
That's
when
the
motorist
pulled
up
and
opened
fire
on
the
suspect.
"It's
fairly
rare"
that
citizens
who
come
to
the
aid
of
law
enforcement
officers
use
deadly
force,
Cecil
said.
Another
motorist
who
stopped
used
the
trooper's
portable
radio
to
call
in
the
shooting.
The
conversation
between
that
driver
and
the
dispatcher
was
very
businesslike,
Cecil
said.
"Hello.
Officer
down,
officer
down
outside
Tonopah.
Come
in,
please,"
the
man
says,
according
to
audio
archived
on
Broadcastify,
which
streams
radio
communications
between
emergency
responders.
"He's
in
real
bad
shape.
Please
send
air
support,
helicopter,
please."
He
tells
the
dispatcher
there
are
two
other
people
who
are
down
in
an
"unknown
condition."
Cecil
praised
the
motorists
who
stopped
to
help,
saying,
"They
were
calm,
determined."
A
woman
who
was
ejected
from
the
vehicle
died
at
a
hospital,
authorities
said.
Authorities
didn't
release
the
names
of
the
people
involved
in
the
incident,
which
occurred
after
4
a.m.
near
mile
marker
89,
west
of
Tonopah.
That
city
is
about
50
miles
west
of
Phoenix.
