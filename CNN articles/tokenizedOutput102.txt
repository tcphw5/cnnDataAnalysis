(CNN)The
city
of
Seattle
could
file
charges
against
a
drone
owner
after
the
device
crashed
on
top
Seattle's
iconic
Space
Needle.CNN's

reportSeattle
police
continue
to
investigate
the
incident,
but
a
source
close
to
the
investigation
confirms
authorities
identified
the
owner
through
the
drone's
serial
number.
The
drone
crashed
on
top
of
the
Space
Needle
on
New
Year's
Eve,
but
it
was
turned
over
to
police
on
January
10.
Police
tell
CNN
that
Space
Needle
management
went
to
the
Federal
Aviation
Administration
to
report
the
incident,
but
were
informed
they
first
needed
to
make
a
report
with
local
authorities.
The
FAA
said
the
incident
is
under
investigation.
The
city
attorney's
office
tells
CNN
while
the
city
does
not
have
any
drone
ordinances,
it
could
charge
the
owner
with
reckless
endangerment.
That
charge,
a
gross
misdemeanor,
carries
a
penalty
of
up
to
364
days
in
jail
and
up
to
a
$5,000
fine.
In
October
2015,
the
city
of
Seattle
charged
a
man
with
reckless
endangerment
for
allegedly
losing
control
of
his
drone
at
the
city's
gay
pride
parade.
As
that
drone
fell,
it
crashed
into
a
building
and
then
hit
a
woman,
knocking
her
unconscious.
That
case
is
currently
under
trial.
Video
given
to
CNN
by
Space
Needle
management,
and
taken
from
the
device,
shows
the
drone
hovering
around
the
observation
deck
before
it
careens
onto
a
platform
near
the
bottom
of
a
holiday
light
display.
A
few
people
were
working
on
the
platform
at
the
time.
The
building,
which
tops
out
at
605
feet
with
the
spire,
was
not
damaged.
"It
looks
like
the
drone
tractor
beam
we
installed
on
the
Space
Needle
is
working,"
said
Space
Needle
CEO
Ron
Sevart
in
a
statement
to
CNN.
"This
is
the
third
time
we've
recovered
a
drone
on
our
property."
