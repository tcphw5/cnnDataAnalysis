story
has
been
updated
to
include
new
information.
(CNN)Classified
documents
presented
last
week
to
President
Obama
and
President-elect
Trump
included
allegations
that
Russian
operatives
claim
to
have
compromising
personal
and
financial
information
about
Mr.
Trump,
multiple
US
officials
with
direct
knowledge
of
the
briefings
tell
CNN.
The
allegations
were
presented
in
a
two-page
synopsis
that
was
appended
to
a
report
on
Russian
interference
in
the
2016
election.
The
allegations
came,
in
part,
from
memos
compiled
by
a
former
British
intelligence
operative,
whose
past
work
US
intelligence
officials
consider
credible.
The
FBI
is
investigating
the
credibility
and
accuracy
of
these
allegations,
which
are
based
primarily
on
information
from
Russian
sources,
but
has
not
confirmed
many
essential
details
in
the
memos
about
Mr.
Trump.
The
classified
briefings
last
week
were
presented
by
four
of
the
senior-most
US
intelligence
chiefs
--
Director
of
National
Intelligence
James
Clapper,
FBI
Director
James
Comey,
CIA
Director
John
Brennan,
and
NSA
Director
Admiral
Mike
Rogers.
One
reason
the
nation's
intelligence
chiefs
took
the
extraordinary
step
of
including
the
synopsis
in
the
briefing
documents
was
to
make
the
President-elect
aware
that
such
allegations
involving
him
are
circulating
among
intelligence
agencies,
senior
members
of
Congress
and
other
government
officials
in
Washington,
multiple
sources
tell
CNN.
These
senior
intelligence
officials
also
included
the
synopsis
to
demonstrate
that
Russia
had
compiled
information
potentially
harmful
to
both
political
parties,
but
only
released
information
damaging
to
Hillary
Clinton
and
Democrats.
This
synopsis
was
not
an
official
part
of
the
report
from
the
intelligence
community
case
about
Russian
hacks,
but
some
officials
said
it
augmented
the
evidence
that
Moscow
intended
to
harm
Clinton's
candidacy
and
help
Trump's,
several
officials
with
knowledge
of
the
briefings
tell
CNN.
The
two-page
synopsis
also
included
allegations
that
there
was
a
continuing
exchange
of
information
during
the
campaign
between
Trump
surrogates
and
intermediaries
for
the
Russian
government,
according
to
two
national
security
officials.
Sources
tell
CNN
that
these
same
allegations
about
communications
between
the
Trump
campaign
and
the
Russians,
mentioned
in
classified
briefings
for
congressional
leaders
last
year,
prompted
then-Senate
Democratic
Leader
Harry
Reid
to
send
a
letter
to
FBI
Director
Comey
in
October,
in
which
he
wrote,
"It
has
become
clear
that
you
possess
explosive
information
about
close
ties
and
coordination
between
Donald
Trump,
his
top
advisors,
and
the
Russian
government
--
a
foreign
interest
openly
hostile
to
the
United
States."
CNN
has
confirmed
that
the
synopsis
was
included
in
the
documents
that
were
presented
to
Mr.
Trump
but
cannot
confirm
if
it
was
discussed
in
his
meeting
with
the
intelligence
chiefs.
The
Trump
transition
team
declined
repeated
requests
for
comment.
Appearing
on
Late
Night
with
Seth
Meyers,
Kellyanne
Conway,
a
senior
Trump
adviser,
dismissed
the
memos,
as
unverified
and
untrue.
CNN
has
reviewed
a
35-page
compilation
of
the
memos,
from
which
the
two-page
synopsis
was
drawn.
The
memos
have
since
been
published
by
Buzzfeed.
The
memos
originated
as
opposition
research,
first
commissioned
by
anti-Trump
Republicans,
and
later
by
Democrats.
At
this
point,
CNN
is
not
reporting
on
details
of
the
memos,
as
it
has
not
independently
corroborated
the
specific
allegations.
But,
in
preparing
this
story,
CNN
has
spoken
to
multiple
high
ranking
intelligence,
administration,
congressional
and
law
enforcement
officials,
as
well
as
foreign
officials
and
others
in
the
private
sector
with
direct
knowledge
of
the
memos.
Russia
denies
having
"Kompromat"
on
Donald
Tump
Some
of
the
memos
were
circulating
as
far
back
as
last
summer.
What
has
changed
since
then
is
that
US
intelligence
agencies
have
now
checked
out
the
former
British
intelligence
operative
and
his
vast
network
throughout
Europe
and
find
him
and
his
sources
to
be
credible
enough
to
include
some
of
the
information
in
the
presentations
to
the
President
and
President-elect
a
few
days
ago.
On
the
same
day
that
the
President-elect
was
briefed
by
the
intelligence
community,
the
top
four
Congressional
leaders,
and
chairmen
and
ranking
members
of
the
House
and
Senate
intelligence
committees
--
the
so-called
"Gang
of
Eight"
--
were
also
provided
a
summary
of
the
memos
regarding
Mr.
Trump,
according
to
law
enforcement,
intelligence
and
administration
sources.
The
two-page
summary
was
written
without
the
detailed
specifics
and
information
about
sources
and
methods
included
in
the
memos
by
the
former
British
intelligence
official.
That
said,
the
synopsis
was
considered
so
sensitive
it
was
not
included
in
the
classified
report
about
Russian
hacking
that
was
more
widely
distributed,
but
rather
in
an
annex
only
shared
at
the
most
senior
levels
of
the
government:
President
Obama,
the
President-elect,
and
the
eight
Congressional
leaders.
CNN
has
also
learned
that
on
December
9,
Senator
John
McCain
gave
a
full
copy
of
the
memos
--
dated
from
June
through
December,
2016
--
to
FBI
Director
James
Comey.
McCain
became
aware
of
the
memos
from
a
former
British
diplomat
who
had
been
posted
in
Moscow.
But
the
FBI
had
already
been
given
a
set
of
the
memos
compiled
up
to
August
2016,
when
the
former
MI6
agent
presented
them
to
an
FBI
official
in
Rome,
according
to
national
security
officials.
The
raw
memos
on
which
the
synopsis
is
based
were
prepared
by
the
former
MI6
agent,
who
was
posted
in
Russia
in
the
1990s
and
now
runs
a
private
intelligence
gathering
firm.
His
investigations
related
to
Mr.
Trump
were
initially
funded
by
groups
and
donors
supporting
Republican
opponents
of
Mr.
Trump
during
the
GOP
primaries,
multiple
sources
confirmed
to
CNN.
Those
sources
also
said
that
once
Mr.
Trump
became
the
nominee,
further
investigation
was
funded
by
groups
and
donors
supporting
Hillary
Clinton.
Spokespeople
for
the
FBI
and
the
Director
of
National
Intelligence
declined
to
comment.
Officials
who
spoke
to
CNN
declined
to
do
so
on
the
record
given
the
classified
nature
of
the
material.
Some
of
the
allegations
were
first
reported
publicly
in
Mother
Jones
one
week
before
the
election.
One
high
level
administration
official
told
CNN,
"I
have
a
sense
the
outgoing
administration
and
intelligence
community
is
setting
down
the
pieces
so
this
must
be
investigated
seriously
and
run
down.
I
think
[the]
concern
was
to
be
sure
that
whatever
information
was
out
there
is
put
into
the
system
so
it
is
evaluated
as
it
should
be
and
acted
upon
as
necessary."
