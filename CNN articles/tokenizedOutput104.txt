(CNN)President
Donald
Trump
on
Monday
will
start
to
unravel
the
behemoth
trade
deal
he
inherited
from
his
predecessor,
as
he
signed
an
executive
action
to
withdraw
from
the
negotiating
process

the

explainedCNN's
Jeff
Zeleny
contributed
to
this
report.That
executive
action
sends
signals
to
Democrats
and
leaders
in
foreign
capitals
around
the
world
that
Trump's
rhetoric
on
trade
during
the
campaign
is
turning
into
action.
Trump
vowed
during
the
campaign
to
withdraw
the
US
from
the
Pacific
trade
deal,
commonly
known
as
TPP,
which
he
argued
was
harmful
to
American
workers
and
manufacturing.
The
TPP
was
negotiated
under
former
President
Barack
Obama,
but
never
ratified
by
Congress,
so
withdrawing
from
it
will
not
have
an
immediate,
real
effect
on
US
economic
policies,
although
it
does
signal
a
new
and
very
different
US
outlook
on
trade
under
Trump.
The
other
executive
actions
signed
Monday
included
reinstating
the
Mexico
City
abortion
rules
and
instituting
a
hiring
freeze
for
federal
agencies.

Press
feuds
and
protests
Trump's
action
comes
as
the
President
is
looking
to
change
the
conversation
after
a
rocky
first
weekend
at
the
White
House,
during
which,
he
and
his
officials
feuded
with
the
press
and
his
presidency
was
greeted
with
massive
protests
in
the
nation's
capital
and
in
large
cities
across
the
US.
The
executive
action
was
just
one
part
of
the
Trump
administration's
efforts
to
focus
attention
on
its
plans
to
radically
reshape
US
trade
policies,
making
good
on
a
central
premise
of
Trump's
campaign
and
its
economic
nationalist
underbelly.
Trump
on
Monday
also
met
with
union
leaders
and
blue-collar
workers
several
hours
after
signing
the
executive
action
and
had
a
separate
meeting
with
business
leaders.
As
the
Republican
nominee,
Trump
railed
against
free
trade
agreements
he
argued
were
lopsided
against
the
US
and
vowed
to
implement
more
protectionist
trade
policies
as
president,
rallying
voters
to
the
polls
with
his
"America
First"
slogan.
Trump
has
also
threatened
to
impose
trade
tariffs
as
a
way
to
revive
American
manufacturing
and
compel
US
companies
not
to
take
their
manufacturing
operations
abroad.
New
agenda
Obama's
administration
worked
with
the
11
countries
that
became
signatories
for
more
than
two
years
to
formulate
the
massive
free
trade
deal
that
was
set
to
reshape
commerce
throughout
the
Pacific
Rim,
triggering
movement
among
multinational
companies
in
the
region
at
the
same
time.
Trump's
election
swiftly
dealt
a
death
knell
--
one
formalized
on
Monday
--
to
the
deal,
sending
shockwaves
in
Asian
capitals
that
had
pinned
their
economic
hopes
on
the
deal.
Trump's
decision
to
withdraw
the
US
from
TPP
is
also
a
first
step
in
the
administration's
efforts
to
amass
a
governing
coalition
to
push
the
new
President's
agenda,
one
that
includes
the
blue-collar
workers
who
defected
from
Democrats
and
flocked
to
Trump's
candidacy
in
November.
The
move
could
also
put
many
Democrats
--
particularly
those
who
opposed
the
trade
deal
--
in
a
tricky
position
as
they
look
to
hold
on
to
union
support,
a
key
constituency
in
their
political
coalition.
Obama
struggled
to
sell
many
Democrats
on
the
trade
deal,
in
particular
because
of
concerns
about
how
the
trade
deal
would
impact
American
manufacturers
and
the
US
workers
in
that
industry.
Even
Hillary
Clinton,
the
Democratic
presidential
nominee
who
pushed
the
TPP
deal
as
secretary
of
state,
backed
off
her
support
for
the
deal
during
the
campaign
amid
pressure
from
the
left.
Democrats
with
heavy
union
worker
constituencies
will
either
need
to
get
on
board
with
Trump's
protectionist
trade
policies
or
risk
losing
reelection.
Republican
leaders,
many
of
whom
supported
the
TPP
trade
deal
and
free
trade
more
broadly,
will
also
be
pressed
to
react
Monday
--
reactions
that
could
show
daylight
between
top
Republicans
on
Capitol
Hill
and
the
White
House
on
a
top
policy
issue.
Trump
has
said
that
he
also
plans
to
renegotiate
the
North
American
Free
Trade
Agreement,
a
free
trade
deal
joining
the
US,
Mexico
and
Canada.
