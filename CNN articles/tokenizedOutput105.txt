(CNN)They
may
be
in
opposite
corners
of
the

but
Hong
Kong,
Sydney
and
Vancouver
have
one
thing
in
common.Sydney's

Elliott,
associate
director

at

Lang
LaSalleThey're
the
top
three
most
unaffordable
housing
markets
in
the
world,
according
to
the
13th
Annual
Demographia
International
Housing
Affordability
Survey:
2017,
published
today.
Hong
Kong
has
topped
the
list
for
the
past
seven
years
--
since
its
first
appearance
in
the
survey.
Subdivided
flats
smaller
than
100
square
feet
(9
square
meters)
can
rent
for
$385
in
the
Asian
city.
"Hong
Kong
is
a
small
island
with
7
million
people
...
and
you
have
1.5
billion
across
the
border
(in
mainland
China)
who
would
like
to
invest,"
Mark
Elliott,
associate
director
of
International
Residential
Property
Services
at
Jones
Lang
LaSalle,
tells
CNN.
"The
government
is
releasing
more
and
more
land,
but
...
they
will
have
to
be
more
creative
about
making
sites
available,
at
affordable
levels,
to
keep
the
market
where
it
is."
How
the
survey
works
The
Demographia
report
scores
housing
markets
using
the
"median
multiple"
principle,
which
takes
median
house
price
divided
by
gross
annual
median
household
income
to
calculate
affordability.
This
method
has
been
recommended
by
the
World
Bank
and
the
United
Nations.
For
instance,
if
the
median
house
price
in
London
is
£440,000
and
the
median
household
income
is
£51,800,
the
housing
market
score
would
be
8.5.
A
total
of
406
urban
markets
were
analyzed
in
nine
countries
--
Australia,
Canada,
Hong
Kong,
Ireland,
Japan,
New
Zealand,
Singapore,
United
Kingdom,
and
the
United
States
--
using
data
from
the
third
quarter
of
2016.
Hong
Kong
clocked
an
18.1
median
multiple
score,
down
from
a
record-setting
19
points
the
year
before
--
Sydney
scored
12.2
(the
same
as
last
year)
and
Vancouver
11.8.
Other
markets
in
the
top
10
included
San
Jose
in
the
United
States
(9.6),
Honolulu
in
Hawaii
(9.4),
and
Bournemouth
and
Dorset
in
the
United
Kingdom
(8.9).
In
Los
Angeles
(9.3)
house
prices
rose
the
equivalent
of
14
months
in
household
income
in
only
12
months,
the
report
said.
Australia's
rising
prices
When
comparing
nations,
Hong
Kong
--
a
Special
Administrative
Region
of
China
--
topped
the
charts
again,
with
a
score
(18.1)
three
times
that
of
New
Zealand,
in
second
place
at
5.9.
Australia
is
now
the
third
most
expensive
nation
in
which
to
buy,
with
a
median
multiple
score
of
5.5.
Prices
there
have
risen
dramatically
since
the
1980s,
when
--
by
Demographia's
calculations
--
all
its
major
markets,
with
the
exception
of
Sydney,
were
in
the
affordable
housing
level.
This
year,
all
but
seven
of
Australia's
54
markets
in
the
survey
are
ranked
as
either
"seriously
unaffordable"
or
"severely
unaffordable".
"Sydney's
housing
prices
shot
up
because
foreign
investors
are
buying
trophy
assets,
in
places
like
Bondi,"
says
Elliot.
"It's
not
sustainable
growth
because
they're
not
being
rented
out
and
they're
completely
pricing
people
in
the
local
market
out
of
buying."
"The
problem
in
Australia
is
that
the
only
people
who
can
afford
to
play
the
market
in
Sydney
and
Melbourne
are
Russians,
Chinese
and
Middle
Eastern
investors."
