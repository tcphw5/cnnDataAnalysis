(CNN)A
petition
to
stop
US
President
Donald
Trump's
making
an
official
state
visit
to
Britain
had
gained
more
than
a
million
signatures
by
Monday,
in
a
backlash
to
Trump's
controversial
ban
on
citizens
from
seven
Muslim-majority
countries
from
entering
the
United
States.
What
we
know
so
farWhat
it's
like
in
the
7
impacted
countriesCNN's
Angela
Dewan
wrote
from
London.The
petition
to
ban
Trump
from
making
the
visit
was
created
on
the
country's
Government
and
Parliament
website
at
the
end
of
November,
long
before
Trump's
announcement,
and
had
gained
just
372
signatures
in
two
months.
News
spread
over
the
weekend
of
Trump's
travel
ban,
and
by
10
am
on
Monday,
the
number
of
signatures
on
the
petition
had
soared,
and
it's
still
rising
fast.
Graham
Guest,
the
British
lawyer
who
created
the
petition,
said
he
had
no
specific
issue
or
policy
position
in
mind
when
he
started
the
petition.
It
was
just
Trump
the
man,
really.
"Maybe
Trump's
travel
ban
has
angered
people
and
they
want
him
to
know
what
it's
like
to
be
banned
from
a
country,"
he
wrote
to
CNN.
The
petition
says
Trump
would
be
allowed
into
the
country,
but
that
an
official
state
visit
would
"cause
embarrassment
to
Her
Majesty
the
Queen."
"Donald
Trump's
well
documented
misogyny
and
vulgarity
disqualifies
him
from
being
received
by
Her
Majesty
the
Queen
or
the
Prince
of
Wales.
Therefore
during
the
term
of
his
presidency
Donald
Trump
should
not
be
invited
to
the
United
Kingdom
for
an
official
State
Visit,"
the
petition
states.
This
is
not
the
first
time
Trump
has
faced
such
calls.
In
January
last
year,
a
petition
to
ban
him
from
the
UK
after
he
made
controversial
remarks
about
Muslims
gained
almost
590,000
signatures
and
was
debated
in
Parliament,
with
MPs
from
all
major
parties
denouncing
him.
The
proposed
ban,
however,
did
not
go
to
a
vote.
PM
Theresa
May:
'We
do
not
agree'
British
Foreign
Secretary
Boris
Johnson
described
Trump's
travel
ban
as
"divisive
and
wrong,"
while
London
Mayor
Sadiq
Khan
said
the
move
was
"shameful
and
cruel."
Under
intense
pressure
to
take
a
position,
Prime
Minister
Theresa
May
conceded
Sunday,
when
one
of
her
spokespeople
said
"we
do
not
agree
with
this
kind
of
approach,"
adding
that
immigration
was
a
matter
for
the
US
to
decide
on
its
own.
"We've
been
very
clear
that
the
invitation
has
been
extended
and
it
has
been
accepted,"
a
spokesperson
for
May
said
on
Monday
after
the
petition
surpassed
1
million
signatures.
"The
UK
and
the
US
have
a
very
strong
and
close
relationship
and
it's
right
that
we
continue
to
work
together.
In
terms
of
the
petition
being
signed,
it
will
be
a
matter
for
parliament
now
on
whether
it
is
debated."
May
was
the
first
foreign
leader
to
meet
officially
with
Trump,
on
Friday
in
Washington,
where
Trump
accepted
an
invitation
for
a
reciprocal
visit.
According
to
the
rules,
any
petition
with
100,000
signatures
or
more
automatically
qualifies
for
consideration
to
be
debated
in
Parliament,
though
there
are
no
guarantees.
Will
Guest
attend
the
hearing
if
it
pans
out?
"Absolutely!"
