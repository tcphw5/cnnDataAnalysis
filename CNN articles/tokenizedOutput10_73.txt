(CNN)The
cast
of
"Stranger
Things"
won
big
at
Sunday
night's
SAG
Awards,
and
star
David
Harbour
used
his
moment
in
the
spotlight
to
deliver
a
speech
that
got
some
of
his
fellow
actors
on
their
feet.
"We
will
get
past
the
lies.
We
will
hunt
monsters.
And
when
we
are
at
a
loss
amidst
the
hypocrisy
and
casual
violence
of
certain
individuals
and
institutions,
we
will,
as
per
Chief
Jim
Hopper,
punch
some
people
in
the
face
when
they
seek
to
destroy
what
we
have
envisioned
for
ourselves
and
the
marginalized.
And
we
will
do
it
all
with
soul,
with
heart,
and
with
joy.
We
thank
you
for
this
responsibility!"

Harbour,
who
plays
Chief
Jim
Hopper
on
the
Netflix
series,
spoke
for
the
cast
as
they
took
the
stage
to
accept
their
award
for
best
ensemble
in
a
drama
series.
"This
award
from
you,
who
take
your
craft
seriously
and
earnestly
believe,
like
me,
that
great
acting
can
change
the
world
is
a
call
to
arms
from
our
fellow
craftsmen
and
women
to
go
deeper
and,
through
our
art,
to
battle
against
fear,
self-centeredness
and
exclusivity
of
our
predominantly
narcissistic
culture,"
he
said.
"And
through
our
craft,
cultivate
a
more
empathetic
and
understanding
society
by
revealing
intimate
truths
that
serve
as
a
forceful
reminder
to
folks
that
when
they
feel
broken,
and
afraid
and
tired
they
are
not
alone."

Harbour's
words
caused
his
co-star
Winona
Ryder
to
pump
her
fist
in
the
air.
"We
are
united
in
that
we
are
all
human
beings,
and
we
are
all
together
on
this
horrible,
painful,
joyous,
exciting
and
mysterious
ride
that
is
being
alive,"
Harbour
said.
Harbour
ended
his
speech
with
a
call
to
action
on
what
was
already
a
politically-charged
evening.
"Now,
as
we
act
in
the
continuing
narrative
of
'Stranger
Things,'
we
1983
midwesterners
will
repel
bullies,
we
will
shelter
freaks
and
outcasts
--
those
who
have
no
homes
--
[and]
we
will
get
past
the
lies,
we
will
hunt
monsters
and
when
we
are
lost
amidst
the
hypocrisy
and
casual
violence
of
certain
individuals
and
institutions,
we
will
as
per
Chief
Jim
Hopper,
punch
some
people
in
the
face
when
they
seek
to
destroy
the
weak,
and
the
disenfranchised
and
the
marginalized
and
we
will
do
it
all
with
soul,
with
heart
and
joy,"
he
said.
"Hidden
Figures"
star
Taraji
P.
Henson
cheered
from
the
crowd.
"The
People
v.
O.J.
Simpson"
star
Courtney
B.
Vance
stood
from
his
seat.
And
"Orange
is
the
New
Black"
cast
member
Lea
DeLaria
put
two
hands
in
the
air.
"We
thank
you
for
this
responsibility,"
Harbour
added.

Speaking
backstage
after
the
awards,
Harbour
said
while
the
cast
was
not
anticipating
a
win,
he
had
written
his
speech
because
he's
"bad
at
improvisation."
"I
did
not
want
to
go
up
there
with
nothing
to
say,"
he
said,
adding
that
the
speech
went
through
"many
iterations."
"I've
had
a
lot
of
feelings
and
thoughts
this
last
week
and
I
wanted
to
express
it
in
some
way
that
dealt
with
what
we
do
through
our
art,"
he
said,
making
reference
to
the
various
executive
orders
put
in
place
by
President
Donald
Trump,
without
mentioning
Trump
by
name.
In
the
minutes
after
Harbour's
speech,
Ryder's
animated
on-stage
reaction
caught
attention
on
the
internet.
Harbour
said
he
"didn't
see
her
reaction,"
but
claimed
he
did
run
the
speech
by
some
of
his
cast
mates
in
advance.
"I
was
very
appreciative
of
their
feedback,"
he
said.
"Stranger
Things"
beat
out
the
likes
of
"Game
of
Thrones,"
Westworld,"
"Downton
Abbey,"
and
"The
Crown"
in
the
ensemble
category.
