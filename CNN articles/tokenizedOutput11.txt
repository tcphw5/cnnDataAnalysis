(CNN)Reputed
drug
kingpin
Joaquin
"El
Chapo"
Guzman
isn't
happy
with
jail
conditions
in
America,
his
lawyers
said
Friday.
CNN's
Lawrence
Crook,
Ray
Sanchez
and
Catherine
E.
Shoichet
contributed
to
this
report.
Guzman
wore
dark
blue
prison
garb
during
a
status
conference
in
federal
court
in
Brooklyn,
New
York,
where
public
defenders
argued
that
their
client's
23
hours
under
lock-down
each
day,
with
limited
visits,
kept
him
from
selecting
a
private
attorney.
"The
current
restrictions
are
excessive,"
one
attorney,
Michelle
Gelernt
of
the
Federal
Defenders
of
New
York,
told
reporters
after
the
hearing.
Guzman's
wife,
Emma
Coronel,
who
has
not
been
permitted
to
visit
him
at
a
federal
detention
center
in
Manhattan,
attended
the
hearing
but
did
not
comment
outside
court.
"It
has
been
very
difficult,"
Gelernt
said
of
Coronel.
"This
is
the
first
time
she's
seen
him
since
he
was
brought
to
the
United
States."
Guzman
is
charged
with
running
a
massive
drug
smuggling
operation
that
laundered
more
than
$14
billion.
He
faces
other
charges
that
include
operation
of
a
continuing
criminal
enterprise,
conspiring
to
murder
rivals
and
firearms
violations.
The
charges
carry
a
minimum
sentence
of
life
in
prison,
according
to
US
Attorney
Robert
Capers
of
the
Eastern
District
of
New
York.
Mexico's
foreign
ministry
handed
Guzman
over
to
the
US
prosecutors
in
January
after
it
said
it
had
received
assurances
that
if
convicted,
Guzman
would
not
receive
the
death
penalty.
Mexico
opposes
capital
punishment.
During
the
40-minute
hearing,
federal
prosecutors
argued
that
Guzman
had
financial
means
to
afford
lawyers
and
didn't
need
a
public
defender.
They
also
said
the
prior
representation
by
the
federal
defenders
of
five
potential
witnesses
created
a
conflict.
Guzman's
lawyers
said
they
would
provide
the
court
with
a
financial
affidavit.
"We
think
it's
ridiculous
that
the
government
expects
Mr.
Guzman
to
choose
a
counsel
when
he's
locked
up
23
hours
a
day"
with
limited
visitation
rights,
defense
attorney
Michael
Schneider
told
reporters.
"If
they
want
him
to
have
access
to
hire
a
lawyer,
we
believe
he
needs
to
be
able
to
meet
with
his
family
or
at
least
confer
with
his
family,"
Schneider
said.
Gelernt
also
expressed
concern
about
the
legality
of
Guzman's
extradition
from
Mexico,
saying
that
a
Mexican
government
document
agreeing
to
allow
Guzman
to
be
charged
in
Brooklyn
had
not
been
turned
over
to
defense
lawyers.
Guzman's
next
court
appearance
will
be
in
May.
A
US
judge
initially
ruled
that
Guzman,
59,
would
appear
in
court
by
video,
but
the
order
was
changed
after
his
attorneys
asked
the
court
to
reconsider.
Guzman's
attorneys
argued
their
client's
absence
in
court
would
be
prejudicial,
creating
the
appearance
that
he
is
too
dangerous
to
appear
at
the
hearing.
Guzman
has
been
detained
at
a
federal
detention
center
in
Manhattan
since
his
extradition.
A
game
of
cat-and-mouse
A
day
after
his
extradition,
the
master
of
escape,
"El
Chapo"
pleaded
not
guilty
in
the
New
York
federal
court.
The
indictment
alleges
that
from
1989
to
2014
Guzman
led
a
criminal
enterprise
responsible
for
importing
and
distributing
massive
amounts
of
narcotics
and
conspiring
to
murder
rivals
who
posed
a
threat,
Capers
said.
For
years,
the
notorious
cartel
leader
played
a
game
of
cat-and-mouse
with
the
law.
In
January
2001,
he
escaped
from
a
prison
in
Jalisco
in
a
laundry
cart.
Guzman
was
apprehended
in
February
2014.
He
escaped
again
in
July
2015
from
the
maximum-security
Altiplano
federal
prison
near
Toluca,
Mexico,
by
crawling
through
an
opening
in
the
shower
area
of
his
cell
block
leading
to
a
mile-long
tunnel.
He
was
later
captured
in
January
2016.
"El
Chapo"
is
the
noted
leader
of
the
Sinaloa
Cartel,
which
the
US
Justice
Department
describes
as
"one
of
the
world's
most
prolific,
violent
and
powerful
drug
cartels,"
moving
billions
and
billions
of
dollars
in
marijuana,
cocaine,
heroin
and
methamphetamine.
Trafficking
these
drugs
into
the
United
States
from
Mexico
is
a
business
worth
$19
billion
to
$20
billion
annually,
according
to
a
Department
of
Homeland
Security
report.
