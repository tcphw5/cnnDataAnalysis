McDonald
offered
no
other
details
of
Hurt's
passing.
Known
for
playing
tormented
characters,
Hurt
memorably
died
on
screen
in
the
1979
space
adventure
"Alien"
when
a
creature
exploded
from
his
chest
during
lunch
in
the
spacecraft
mess
hall.
CNN's
"The
Screening
Room"
in
2007
ranked
it
among
its
Top
10
favorite
movie
deaths.
Hurt
always
stayed
busy,
working
more
than
six
decades
in
television,
movies
and
voice
work
in
England
and
the
United
States.
He
recently
played
a
priest
who
counsels
Jacqueline
Kennedy
in
last
year's
biopic
"Jackie,"
according
to
IMDb.
"I'm
very
much
of
the
opinion
that
to
work
is
better
than
not
to
work,"
he
said,
according
to
his
IMDb
bio.
"There
are
others
who'd
say,
'No,
wait
around
for
the
right
thing'
-
and
they
will
finish
up
a
purer
animal
than
me.
...
Of
course,
I
don't
do
everything
by
any
means:
I
do
turn
lots
of
stuff
down,
because
it's
absolute
crap.
But
I
usually
find
something
interesting
enough
to
do."
Accolades
poured
in
on
social
media.
Actor
Kiefer
Sutherland
tweeted:
"My
deepest
sympathies
to
John
Hurt's
family,
friends
and
fans.
He
was
a
dear
friend."
Actor
Elijah
Wood
tweeted:
"Very
sad
to
hear
of
John
Hurt's
passing.
It
was
such
an
honor
to
have
watched
you
work,
sir."
Hurt
was
born
in
Shirebrook,
a
coal
mining
village
in
Derbyshire,
England,
the
son
of
an
an
engineer
and
one-time
actress
and
an
Anglican
clergyman
and
mathematician,
IMDb
said.
He
trained
to
become
a
painter
but,
after
being
accepted
into
the
Royal
Academy
of
Dramatic
Art,
worked
on
the
stage
in
the
early
1960s.
His
first
film
role
came
in
the
"angry
young
man"
drama
"Young
and
Willing"
in
1962
and
his
first
major
role
in
"A
Man
for
All
Seasons"
in
1966,
IMDb
said.
His
big
break
came
when
he
portrayed
the
gay
writer
and
raconteur
Quentin
Crisp
in
the
mid-1970s
television
play
"The
Naked
Civil
Servant,"
which
was
adapted
from
Crisp's
autobiography,
IMDb
said.
The
good
roles
kept
coming.
He
went
on
to
play
a
Turkish
prison
inmate
in
"Midnight
Express"
in
1978
and
the
gentle,
disfigured
John
Merrick
in
"The
Elephant
Man"
in
1980.
Those
roles
earned
him
Oscar
nominations
and
he
won
a
Golden
Globe
for
best
supporting
actor
in
"Midnight
Express."
He
usually
played
characters
with
problems,
and
IMDb
said
he
died
47
times
on
screen.
But
Hurt
also
also
had
comic
roles,
such
as
Jesus
in
Mel
Brooks'
"History
of
the
World:
Part
I"
in
1981,
which
he
took
on
because
he'd
just
done
two
serious
roles
and
wanted
to
have
some
fun,
IMDb
said.
Hurt
appeared
in
the
first
two
Harry
Potter
movies,
playing
wand
maker
Garrick
Ollivander,
and
did
voice
work
and
narration
in
movies
like
"Watership
Down,"
"The
Plague
Dogs,"
and
"Thumbelina."
Some
of
his
top
television
roles
included
Caligula
in
"I,
Claudius"
in
1976,
General
Woundwort
in
"Watership
Down"
and
the
War
Doctor
in
"Doctor
Who."
He
was
awarded
the
CBE
(Commander
of
the
Order
of
the
British
Empire)
in
the
2004
Queen's
Birthday
Honours
List
for
his
services
to
Drama.
Hurt
was
married
four
times
and
was
married
to
Anwen
Rees-Myers
when
he
died.
Hurt
was
an
alcoholic
for
years
but
said
he
quit
drinking
in
2005,
according
to
IMDb.
A
grand
scheme
never
guided
his
life,
he
said.
"I've
just
been
whipped
along
by
the
waves
I'm
sitting
in,"
he
said,
according
to
IMDb.
"I
don't
make
plans
at
all.
Plans
are
what
make
God
laugh.
You
can
make
plans,
you
can
make
so
many
plans,
but
they
never
go
right,
do
they?"
