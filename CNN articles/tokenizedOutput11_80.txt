(CNN)President
Donald
Trump
could
sign
an
executive
order
or
presidential
memorandum
initiating
an
investigation
into
voter
fraud
as
early
as
Thursday,
a
senior
administration
official
tells
CNN.
The
investigation
would
be
carried
out
through
the
Department
of
Justice.CNN's
Eleanor
Mueller
and
Theodore
Schleifer
contributed
to
this
report.The
move
would
expand
on
Trump's
interest
in
the
unproven
claims
he
has
made
since
November's
election
alleging
millions
of
illegal
votes
were
cast,
without
citing
any
evidence.
"I
will
be
asking
for
a
major
investigation
into
VOTER
FRAUD,
including
those
registered
to
vote
in
two
states,
those
who
are
illegal
and
...
even,
those
registered
to
vote
who
are
dead
(and
many
for
a
long
time).
Depending
on
results,
we
will
strengthen
up
voting
procedures!"
Trump
wrote
in
two
consecutive
tweets
Wednesday
morning.
The
President
wants
to
discuss
the
issue
with
Republican
lawmakers
Thursday
in
Philadelphia
and
will
then
consider
the
best
way
to
go
about
starting
the
investigation.
"He
wants
to
tell
them
more
about
why
he
is
talking
about
voter
fraud"
before
taking
any
action,
the
official
said.
Should
Trump
decide
on
the
best
course
of
action,
the
official
said,
the
move
could
come
as
early
as
Thursday.
There
is
some
concern
within
the
Trump
White
House
about
initiating
the
action
before
Sen.
Jeff
Sessions,
Trump's
pick
to
be
attorney
general,
is
confirmed
by
the
Senate.
Trump
lost
the
popular
vote
to
Hillary
Clinton
by
nearly
3
million
votes
in
November,
but
won
the
Electoral
College
and
thus
the
presidency.
Trump,
however,
has
seemingly
been
fixated
on
the
popular
vote,
mentioning
voter
fraud
in
regards
to
his
popular
vote
loss
a
number
of
times
since
November.
Trump's
initial
comments
on
voter
fraud
came
Monday
during
a
meeting
with
congressional
leaders,
where
he
reiterated
an
unsubstantiated
claim
that
3
to
5
million
illegal
votes
cost
him
the
popular
vote,
according
to
two
sources
familiar
with
the
meeting.
The
claims
continued
into
Wednesday,
when
ABC
News
pressed
the
President
on
his
opinion
during
an
interview
at
the
White
House.
"You
have
people
that
are
registered
who
are
dead,
who
are
illegals,
who
are
in
two
states.
You
have
people
registered
in
two
states.
They're
registered
in
a
New
York
and
a
New
Jersey.
They
vote
twice.
There
are
millions
of
votes,
in
my
opinion,"
Mr.
Trump
said.
The
President
insisted
that
he
wants
the
voting
process
to
be
legitimate,
pointing
to
a
Pew
report
that
his
spokesman,
Sean
Spicer,
used
to
bolster
claims
that
there
are
millions
of
illegal
votes
cast
during
presidential
elections.
When
ABC's
David
Muir
told
the
President
that
the
author
of
that
report
told
him
on
Tuesday
night
that
he
found
no
evidence
of
voter
fraud,
Trump
said
that
the
author
was
"groveling."
Trump
said
he
wants
to
launch
an
investigation
into
the
matter.
"Of
those
votes
cast,
none
of
them
come
to
me.
None
of
them
come
to
me.
They
would
all
be
to
the
other
side.
None
of
them
come
to
me.
But
when
you
look
at
the
people
registered,
dead,
illegal,
and
two
states,
and
some
cases
maybe
3
states.
We
have
a
lot
to
look
into,"
he
said.
David
Becker,
the
director
of
the
Pew
study
in
question,
told
CNN's
Wolf
Blitzer
Tuesday
on
"The
Situation
Room"
that
"there
is
absolutely
no
evidence
of
voter
fraud
even
approaching
(the)
scale"
suggested
by
Trump.
"I
agree
completely
with
the
secretaries
of
state
across
the
country,
both
Republicans
and
Democrats,
and
the
National
Association
of
Secretaries
of
State
which
is
bipartisan,
which
has
said,
there
is
absolutely
no
evidence
of
voter
fraud
even
approaching
that
scale,"
he
said.
"Does
voter
fraud
exist?
Yes,
it
does,
in
very
small
numbers.
And
the
election
officials
around
the
country
are
working
to
investigate
and
prosecute
those
dozens
of
cases
that
might
occur
nationwide
in
an
election
like
this.
But
three
to
five
million
illegal
votes
--
that
would
have
been
discovered
not
just
on
Election
Day,
but
well
before,"
he
added.
"Fraudulent
registrations,
not
matching
the
drivers
license
numbers
and
social
security
numbers,
flagged
for
ID
under
federal
law,
extra
provisional
ballots
being
cast
--
all
of
these
things
we
would
have
seen,
and
there
was
zero
evidence
of
that."
On
Tuesday,
Spicer
vigorously
defended
Trump's
statement
about
illegal
voters,
though
neither
Trump
nor
his
surrogates
could
provide
evidence
that
any
substantial
illegal
voting
had
occurred
or
influence
the
popular
vote.
"I
think
in
terms
of
registration,
where
you
have
got
folks
on
rolls
that
have
been
deceased
or
moved
or
registered
in
two
counties
--
this
isn't
just
about
the
2016
election.
This
is
about
the
integrity
of
our
voting
system,"
Spicer
said
Wednesday.
No
proof
for
fraud
claims
Trump
faced
widespread
criticism
for
his
remarks,
including
from
some
congressional
leaders
in
his
own
party,
and
Democrats
have
alleged
that
Republican
efforts
in
the
name
of
fighting
voter
fraud
has
the
effect
of
preventing
or
delaying
legal
voters
who
traditionally
back
Democratic
candidates
Ohio's
secretary
of
state
replied
to
Trump's
tweet
on
Wednesday,
saying
his
office
already
investigated
claims
of
voter
fraud.
"I
responded
...
for
Ohioans,
to
let
them
know
we
already
have
an
investigation,
or
review
as
we
call
it,
underway,"
Jon
Husted,
a
Republican,
told
CNN's
Carol
Costello
Wednesday.
"In
the
past
...
we
found
less
than
a
thousand
cases
of
voter
irregularity,
less
than
a
couple
hundred
cases
of
voter
fraud,
and
zero
cases
of
voter
suppression."
Considering
Ohio
is
home
to
about
7
million
registered
voters,
these
cases
constitute
"a
small
number,"
Husted
said.
The
reviews,
which
take
place
every
two
years,
are
best
conducted
at
the
state
level,
Husted
said.
"I
don't
think
that
federal
involvement
is
important
in
this
particular
matter,
because
the
states
run
the
elections,"
Husted
said.
"We
don't
want
federal
involvement
in
our
elections,
we
want
to
keep
this
in
the
hands
of
the
states
--
that's
where
it
should
be."
Former
Democratic
National
Committee
chair
Rep.
Debbie-Wasserman
Schultz
issued
a
harsh
condemnation
of
Trump's
call
for
an
investigation,
telling
CNN's
"New
Day"
that
the
tweet's
message
was
"deeply
disturbing."
"He
seems
to
be
questioning
the
legitimacy
of
his
own
election,
all
while,
for
the
last
couple
of
months,
touting
how
legitimate
and
huge
his
election
was
and
historic
it
is.
It
can't
be
both,"
she
said.
"What
is
the
most
deeply
disturbing
about
his
penchant
for
lying
is
--
if
he
is
willing
to
lie
about
the
trivial,
like
crowd
size,
or
the
significant,
like
voter
fraud,
then
what
happens
if
--
God
forbid
--
we
go
to
war
and
we
have
our
troops
lives
on
the
line
and
there
are
causalities?
Is
he
going
to
send
Sean
Spicer
out
to
lie
about
the
causalities
that
have
taken
place?
Are
our
allies
going
to
be
able
to
trust
us?"
And
former
President
Barack
Obama's
senior
adviser
David
Axelrod
responded
on
CNN
on
Wednesday
by
saying,
"It
becomes
an
impetus
for
those
who
want
to
further
erode
voter
protection
for
people
who
legitimately
want
to
vote
and
are
facing
a
series
of
barriers."
When
pushed
by
the
media
about
whether
Trump
will
call
for
an
investigation
into
the
matter,
Spicer
said,
"maybe
we
will,"
adding
later
that
Trump
believes
in
voter
fraud
based
on
"studies
and
information
he
has."
"The
President
does
believe
that,
I
think
he's
stated
that
before,
and
stated
his
concern
of
voter
fraud
and
people
voting
illegally
during
the
campaign
and
continues
to
maintain
that
belief
based
on
studies
and
evidence
people
have
brought
to
him,"
Spicer
said
at
Wednesday's
press
briefing.
Spicer
did
not
say
specifically
Tuesday
which
studies
the
President
was
using
to
support
his
claim
of
3
million
to
5
million
illegally
cast
votes,
but
a
2014
study
by
Jesse
Richman
and
David
Earnest
found
more
than
14%
of
non-citizens
in
2008
and
2010
"indicated
that
they
were
registered
to
vote."
Only
US
citizens
can
vote
in
federal
elections.
However,
Brian
Schaffner,
a
political
scientist
at
the
University
of
Massachusetts,
told
CNN
on
Tuesday
that
his
study
that
is
apparently
being
cited
by
the
White
House
was
misinterpreted
and
did
not
support
the
administration's
claims.
A
number
of
studies
have
also
found
no
evidence
of
widespread
voter
fraud.
The
Truth
About
Voter
Fraud,
a
report
written
by
experts
at
The
Brennan
Center
for
Justice,
found
voter
fraud
rates
were
between
0.00004%
and
0.0009%.
Trump
himself
--
through
his
lawyers
--
has
also
argued
that
there
was
no
evidence
of
voter
fraud
in
the
2016
election.
In
a
court
filing
objecting
to
Green
Party
candidate
Jill
Stein's
Michigan
recount
petition,
lawyers
for
the
president
wrote,
"All
available
evidence
suggests
that
the
2016
general
election
was
not
tainted
by
fraud
or
mistake."
Legal
issues
on
voter
rolls
Judges
have
identified
examples
of
systemic
efforts
to
distort
the
voter
rolls
in
recent
years.
But
those
efforts
hurt
traditionally
Democratic
voters
and
help
Republicans.
In
North
Carolina,
a
federal
appeals
court
wrote
in
2016
that
--
after
receiving
data
on
the
use
of
voting
practices
by
race
--
the
Republican-controlled
state
legislature
enacted
a
series
of
laws
designed
to
suppress
African-American
turnout
with
"almost
surgical
precision."
The
state
required
voters
to
present
forms
of
identification
disproportionately
used
by
white
people.
It
cut
back
on
early
voting,
eliminated
same-day
voter
registration
and
preregistration
for
voters
under
18,
and
it
eliminated
Sunday
voting
--
with
the
state
even
arguing
in
court
that
"counties
with
Sunday
voting
in
2014
were
disproportionately
black"
and
"disproportionately
Democratic."
US
Circuit
Judge
Diana
Motz
wrote
in
July
2016,
in
a
ruling
striking
down
North
Carolina's,
that
the
laws
were
"enacted
with
racially
discriminatory
intent."
"The
General
Assembly
enacted
them
in
the
immediate
aftermath
of
unprecedented
African
American
voter
participation
in
a
state
with
a
troubled
racial
history
and
racially
polarized
voting,"
Motz
wrote.
Still,
many
North
Carolina
counties
worked
around
Motz's
ruling.
Guilford,
the
state's
third-largest
county,
opened
just
one
polling
place
for
the
first
week
of
early
voting.
Charlotte's
Mecklenburg
County
chopped
its
early
voting
locations
from
22
when
early
voting
began
in
2012
to
10
in
2016,
with
voters
reporting
waiting
in
line
for
three
hours.
Democrats
also
believe
that
new
voter
ID
laws
played
a
role
in
lowering
turnout
in
other
states
--
particularly
Wisconsin,
where
Hillary
Clinton
narrowly
lost
to
Trump.
Turnout
there
dropped
nearly
four
points
from
2012,
despite
record
early
voting
numbers.
