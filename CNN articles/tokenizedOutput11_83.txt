Britain's

the

told

that
this
trajectory
was
part
of
an
automatic
self-destruct
sequence.
The

missile
diverted
into

ocean
--
an
automatic
procedure
when
missile
electronics
detect
an
anomaly.

sends
chill
across
Europe
A
month
after
the
test,
the
UK
parliament
approved
the
renewal
of
Trident
at
a
cost
of
Â£40
billion.
Unaware
of
the
failure,
members
of
the
House
of
Commons
voted
by
472
votes
to
117
in
favor
of
renewal.
On
Sunday,
British
Prime
Minister
Theresa
May
was
asked
four
times
during
an
interview
with
the
BBC's
Andrew
Marr
Show
whether
she
knew
of
the
missile
failure
before
the
vote.
May
refused
to
answer.
Government
challenged
on
CNN
report
Forced
to
make
a
statement
on
the
controversy
in
the
House
of
Commons
on
Monday,
British
Defense
Secretary
Michael
Fallon
said
he
had
"absolute
confidence"
in
Trident
but
refused
to
give
"operational
details"
about
the
test.
CNN
published
this
story
just
as
Fallon
spoke,
and
Mary
Creagh,
of
the
opposition
Labour
Party
demanded
to
know
why
he
would
not
give
any
further
details.
Citing
CNN's
story
she
said:
"The
Secretary
of
State
has
advised
us
not
to
believe
everything
we
read
in
the
Sunday
newspapers,
but
should
we
believe
the
[US]
official
who,
while
we've
been
sitting
here
debating,
has
confirmed
to
CNN
that
the
missile
did
auto-self-destruct
off
the
coast
of
Florida?
And
if
that
is
the
case,
why
is
the
British
parliament
and
the
British
public
the
last
people
to
know?"
Fallon
once
again
declined
to
give
"operational
details".
Another
Labour
lawmaker,
Chris
Byrant,
said
the
reporting
by
CNN
and
the
Sunday
Times
demonstrated
the
need
for
a
full
investigation.
"We
deplore
the
leakage
of
any
information
about
the
nuclear
deterrent
but
it
is
not
for
me
to
comment
on
what
may
or
may
not
be
said
by
the
United
States
administration,"
Fallon
replied.
"This
is
our
submarine,
our
deterrent,
and
it
is
our
responsibility
to
apply
to
it
the
very
highest
security
classification."
May
under
fire
The
UK
government's
refusal
to
discuss
the
missile
failure
has
prompted
criticism
from
opponents
of
the
UK's
nuclear
deterrent.
Scotland's
First
Minister
Nicola
Sturgeon
tweeted:
"This
is
a
hugely
serious
issue.
There
should
be
full
disclosure
of
what
happened,
who
knew
what/when,
and
why
House
of
Commons
wasn't
told."
Earlier
on
Monday,
a
spokeswoman
for
May
said
she
was
briefed
on
the
Trident
test
when
she
came
into
office.
The
Prime
Minister
and
the
Defense
Secretary
are
routinely
informed
about
tests
and
their
outcome,
May's
spokeswoman
told
reporters.
"These
are
known
as
a
'demonstration
and
shakedown'
test.
This
test
was
in
June
(2016)
under
the
last
prime
minister
(David
Cameron).
On
taking
office
the
current
Prime
Minister
(Theresa
May)
was
briefed
on
a
range
of
nuclear
issues,
including
this.
This
test
saw
the
submarine
and
crew
successfully
tested
and
certified."
May
will
become
the
first
world
leader
to
meet
with
new
US
President
Donald
Trump
when
they
hold
talks
in
Washington
on
Friday.
