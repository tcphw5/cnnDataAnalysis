of

it

contributed
to
this
report.A
federal
judge
in
New
York
temporarily
blocked
the
order
Saturday
night
for
citizens
of
seven
Muslim-majority
countries
who
have
already
arrived
in
the
US
and
those
who
are
in
transit,
and
who
hold
valid
visas,
ruling
they
cannot
be
removed
from
the
US.
That
move
limited
part
of
President
Donald
Trump's
executive
order
barring
citizens
from
those
countries
from
entering
the
US
for
the
next
90
days.
Similar
legal
rulings
were
made
in
Virginia
and
Washington
State.
In
Massachusetts,
however,
two
judges
went
further,
saying
the
government
should
notify
travelers
who
would
have
been
affected
by
the
executive
order
that
for
the
next
seven
days
they
are
free
to
travel
to
Boston.
"Customs
and
Border
Protection
shall
notify
airlines
that
have
flights
arriving
at
Logan
Airport
of
this
Order
and
the
fact
that
individuals
on
these
flights
will
not
be
detained
or
returned
based
solely
on
the
basis
of
the
Executive
Order,"
Judges
Allison
Burroughs
and
Judith
Dein
wrote.
Meanwhile,
the
Department
of
Homeland
Security
said
it
"will
comply
with
judicial
orders;
faithfully
enforce
our
immigration
laws,
and
implement
the
president's
Executive
Orders
to
ensure
that
those
entering
the
United
States
do
not
pose
a
threat
to
our
country
or
the
American
people."
Here
are
the
latest
developments:
•
Two
Iraqis
who
were
named
as
the
petitioners
in
the
legal
action
had
been
released
by
Saturday
night.
But
lawyers
said
in
a
court
filing
that
"dozens
and
dozens"
of
people
remained
in
detention
at
John
F.
Kennedy
airport
in
New
York.
•
Protests
are
scheduled
Sunday
at
least
cities
nine
cities:
Orlando,
Boston,
Philadelphia,
New
York,
Atlanta,
Los
Angeles,
Seattle,
Washington
and
Chicago,
mostly
at
airports.
On
Saturday
protesters
converged
on
at
least
eight
major
US
airports,
demonstrating
against
the
policy.
•
President
Trump
said
the
government
was
"totally
prepared"
for
the
ban.
"It's
working
out
very
nicely,"
Trump
told
reporters
Saturday.
"You
see
it
at
the
airports.
You
see
it
all
over."
However.
there
was
widespread
confusion
across
the
country
as
authorities
at
airports
struggled
to
adjust
to
the
new
directives.
Trump
order
blocked
On
Saturday
evening,
the
American
Civil
Liberties
Union
(ACLU)
argued
in
a
federal
court
in
New
York
for
a
nationwide
stay
that
would
block
the
deportation
of
all
people
stranded
in
US
airports
under
what
the
group
called
"President
Trump's
new
Muslim
ban."
US
District
Judge
Ann
Donnelly
granted
the
stay.
"The
petitioners
have
a
strong
likelihood
of
success
in
establishing
that
the
removal
of
the
petitioner
and
other
similarly
situated
violates
their
due
process
and
equal
protection
guaranteed
by
the
United
States
Constitution,"
Donnelly
wrote
in
her
decision.
"There
is
imminent
danger
that,
absent
the
stay
of
removal,
there
will
be
substantial
and
irreparable
injury
to
refugees,
visa-holders,
and
other
individuals
from
nations
subject
to
the
January
27,
2017,
Executive
Order."
The
civil
rights
group
is
representing
dozens
of
travelers
held
at
John
F.
Kennedy
International
Airport
Friday
and
Saturday,
including
two
Iraqis
with
ties
to
the
US
military
who
had
been
granted
visas
to
enter
the
United
States.
The
ruling
does
not
necessarily
mean
the
people
being
held
at
airports
across
the
US
are
going
to
be
released,
said
Zachary
Manfredi,
from
Yale's
Worker
and
Immigrant
Rights
Advocacy
Clinic,
who
helped
draft
the
emergency
stay
motion.
"The
judge's
order
is
that
they
(lawful
visa/green
card
holders)
not
be
removed
from
the
US
--
it
doesn't
immediately
order
that
they
be
released
from
detention,"
he
told
CNN.
"We
are
hoping
that
CBP
(Customs
and
Border
Patrol),
now
that
they
no
longer
have
a
reason
to
detain
them,
will
release
them.
But
it
is
also
possible
they
could
be
transferred
to
(other)
detention
facilities."
"We
are
getting
the
order
to
as
many
CBP
officers
as
possible
right
now,"
he
added.
The
United
States
denied
entry
to
109
travelers
heading
to
the
country
at
the
time
the
ruling
was
signed,
a
Department
of
Homeland
Security
official
said.
The
agency
would
not
say
how
many
of
them
were
sent
already
home
and
how
many
were
detained.
ACLU
Executive
Director
Anthony
D.
Romero
praised
the
ruling,
saying
"our
courts
today
worked
as
they
should
as
bulwarks
against
government
abuse
or
unconstitutional
policies
and
orders.
On
week
one,
Donald
Trump
suffered
his
first
loss
in
court."
Lee
Gelernt,
deputy
director
of
the
ACLU's
Immigrants'
Rights
Project,
who
argued
the
case,
said
the
ruling
"preserves
the
status
quo
and
ensures
that
people
who
have
been
granted
permission
to
be
in
this
country
are
not
illegally
removed
off
U.S.
soil."
Lawsuit
is
first
challenge
to
executive
order
The
class-action
lawsuit
is
the
first
legal
challenge
to
Trump's
controversial
executive
order,
which
indefinitely
suspends
admissions
for
Syrian
refugees
and
limits
the
flow
of
other
refugees
into
the
United
States
by
instituting
what
the
President
has
called
"extreme
vetting"
of
immigrants.
The
two
Iraqis,
Hameed
Khalid
Darweesh
and
Haider
Sameer
Abdulkaleq
Alshawi,
had
been
released
by
Saturday
night.
But
lawyers
for
other
detained
travelers
said
in
a
court
filing
that
"dozens
and
dozens"
of
individuals
remained
held
at
JFK.
Similar
legal
actions
had
been
initiated
in
other
states..
A
federal
court
in
Washington
state
issued
a
stay
forbidding
travelers
being
detained
there
from
being
sent
back
to
their
home
country.
A
federal
court
in
Virginia
has
issued
a
temporary
restraining
order
saying
several
dozen
permanent
residents
returning
from
trips
abroad
should
have
access
to
lawyers
while
they
are
being
detained
at
Dulles
International
Airport
and
these
residents
cannot
be
removed
from
the
United
States
for
seven
days.
Federal
judges
in
Boston
have
ruled
early
Sunday
that
officials
may
not
detain
a
person
on
the
basis
of
President
Trump's
executive
order.
This
ruling
was
made
after
the
ACLU
of
Massachusetts
filed
a
lawsuit
asking
for
the
release
of
two
associate
professors
at
the
University
of
Massachusetts-Dartmouth,
both
Iranian
nationals
who
are
permanent
residents
of
the
United
States.
The
Massachusetts
suit
was
filed
after
the
federal
judge
in
New
York
City
granted
a
stay
of
removal
on
behalf
of
two
Iraqi
nationals
and
others
"similarly
situated"
who
have
been
cleared
to
enter
the
United
States.
Trump's
order,
signed
Friday,
bars
travel
from
seven
Muslim-majority
countries,
including
Iraq,
to
the
US
for
90
days.
It
also
suspends
the
US
Refugee
Admissions
Program
for
120
days
until
it
is
reinstated
"only
for
nationals
of
countries
for
whom"
members
of
Trump's
Cabinet
deem
can
be
properly
vetted.
Released
under
special
circumstances
According
to
court
papers,
both
Darweesh
and
Alshawi
were
legally
allowed
to
come
into
the
US
but
were
detained
in
accordance
with
Trump's
order.
Darweesh,
who
worked
as
an
interpreter
for
the
US
during
the
Iraq
War,
was
released
from
detention
early
Saturday
afternoon.
"America
is
the
land
of
freedom,"
he
told
reporters
at
the
airport
shortly
after
his
release.
"America
is
the
greatest
nation."
A
source
with
knowledge
of
the
case
confirmed
Darweesh
will
be
allowed
into
the
US
due
to
provisions
in
Trump's
order
that
allow
the
State
and
Homeland
Security
departments
to
admit
individuals
into
the
US
on
a
case-by-case
base
for
certain
reasons,
including
when
the
person
is
already
in
transit
and
it
would
cause
undue
hardship
and
would
not
pose
a
threat
to
the
security
of
the
US.
The
suit
said
Darweesh
held
a
special
immigrant
visa,
which
he
was
granted
the
day
of
Trump's
inauguration
on
January
20,
due
to
his
work
for
the
US
government
from
2003
to
2013.
Alshawi
was
released
Saturday
night,
according
to
his
attorney,
Mark
Doss.
Rep.
Nydia
Velazquez,
D-New
York,
who
had
arrived
at
JFK
by
early
Saturday
afternoon
to
try
and
secure
the
release
of
the
two
Iraqis,
railed
against
Trump's
order
and
pledged
continued
action.
"This
should
not
happen
in
America,"
Velazquez
said
following
Darweesh's
release.
"One
by
one,
street
by
street,
if
we
have
to
go
to
court,
we
will
fight
this
anyplace,
anywhere."
'The
executive
order
is
unlawful'
The
lawsuit
said
the
US
granted
Alshawi
a
visa
earlier
this
month
to
meet
with
his
wife
and
son,
whom
the
US
already
granted
refugee
status
for
her
association
with
the
US
military.
The
lawyers
for
the
two
men
called
for
a
hearing
because
they
maintain
the
detention
of
people
with
valid
visas
is
illegal.
"Because
the
executive
order
is
unlawful
as
applied
to
petitioners,
their
continued
detention
based
solely
on
the
executive
order
violates
their
Fifth
Amendment
procedural
and
substantive
due
process
rights,"
the
lawyers
argue
in
court
papers.
Court
papers
said
Customs
and
Border
Protection
authorities
did
not
allow
the
lawyers
to
meet
with
the
men
and
told
them
to
try
reaching
Trump.
Velázquez
and
fellow
New
York
Democratic
Rep.
Jerrold
Nadler
said
they
attempted
to
speak
to
Darweesh
and
Alshawi
at
JFK's
Terminal
4
earlier
Saturday
but
were
denied.
"When
Mr.
Darweesh's
attorneys
approached
CBP
requesting
to
speak
with
Mr.
Darweesh,
CBP
indicated
that
they
were
not
the
ones
to
talk
to
about
seeing
their
client.
When
the
attorneys
asked,
'Who
is
the
person
to
talk
to?'
the
CBP
agents
responded,
'Mr.
President.
Call
Mr.
Trump,'"
the
court
papers
read.
Doss,
an
attorney
with
the
International
Refugee
Assistance
Project,
told
CNN
his
clients
knew
they
had
to
get
to
the
US
as
soon
as
possible
so
they
boarded
the
first
flight
they
could.
The
two
men
had
been
allowed
to
make
phone
calls.
They
do
not
know
each
other,
and
it
is
unclear
if
they
were
held
together
or
separately,
or
if
they
were
kept
in
a
holding
cell,
according
to
Doss.
"Our
courageous
plaintiff
and
countless
others
risked
their
lives
helping
US
service
members
in
Iraq.
Trump's
order
puts
those
who
have
helped
us
in
harm's
way
by
denying
them
the
safe
harbor
they
have
been
promised
in
the
United
States,"
said
Karen
Tumlin,
the
legal
director
of
the
NILC.
The
lawsuit
was
earlier
reported
by
The
New
York
Times.
Legality
questioned
Trump's
executive
order,
titled
"Protection
Of
The
Nation
From
Foreign
Terrorist
Entry
Into
The
United
States,"
makes
good
on
his
longtime
campaign
promise
to
tighten
borders
and
halt
certain
refugees
from
entering
the
United
States.
The
countries
impacted
are
Iran,
Iraq,
Syria,
Sudan,
Libya,
Yemen
and
Somalia,
according
to
a
White
House
official.
It
also
caps
the
total
number
of
refugees
admitted
into
the
United
States
during
the
2017
fiscal
year
at
50,000,
down
more
than
half
from
the
current
level
of
110,000.
"I
am
establishing
new
vetting
measures
to
keep
radical
Islamic
terrorists
out
of
the
United
States
of
America,"
Trump
said
during
the
signing
at
the
Pentagon.
"We
don't
want
them
here."
An
administration
official
told
CNN
if
a
person
has
a
valid
visa
to
enter
the
US
but
is
a
citizen
of
one
of
the
seven
countries
under
the
temporary
travel
ban,
then
the
person
cannot
come
into
the
US.
If
the
person
landed
after
the
order
was
signed
Friday
afternoon,
then
the
person
would
be
detained
and
put
back
on
a
flight
to
their
country
of
citizenship.
Department
of
Homeland
Security
officials
acknowledged
people
who
were
in
the
air
would
be
detained
upon
arrival
and
put
back
on
a
plane
to
their
home
country.
An
official
was
not
able
to
provide
numbers
of
how
many
have
already
been
detained.
After
the
federal
orders
were
issued,
the
department
said
it
"will
continue
to
enforce
all
of
the
president's
Executive
Orders
in
a
manner
that
ensures
the
safety
and
security
of
the
American
people.
"The
president's
Executive
Orders
remain
in
place-prohibited
travel
will
remain
prohibited,
and
the
U.S.
government
retains
its
right
to
revoke
visas
at
any
time
if
required
for
national
security
or
public
safety.
"The
president's
Executive
Order
affects
a
minor
portion
of
international
travelers,
and
is
a
first
step
towards
reestablishing
control
over
America's
borders
and
national
security."
