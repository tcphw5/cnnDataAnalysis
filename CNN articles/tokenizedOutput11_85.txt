(CNN)Doctors
in
India
were
stunned
to
remove
a
tapeworm
measuring
more
than
6
feet
through
a
patient's
mouth,
according
to
a
report
published
this
week
in
the
New
England
Journal
of
Medicine.See

Cyriac
Phillips
wrote
in
an
email
that
the
48-year-old
man
underwent
a
colonoscopy
in
2014
after
complaints
of
"tolerable"
abdominal
pain
that
had
gone
on
for
two
months
and
test
results
indicating
low
hemoglobin
concentrations
in
his
blood.
While
performing
the
colonoscopy,
Phillips
discovered
part
of
the
worm.
"It
was
an
undulating,
moving
piece
of
the
worm,
"
he
said,
"This
worm
segment
was
confirmation
that
there
was
a
tapeworm
infestation
in
this
patient."
After
the
initial
discovery,
doctors
performed
an
endoscopy,
a
procedure
using
a
camera
inserted
into
the
patient's
stomach
to
view
the
intestines.
During
the
procedure,
Phillips
and
his
team
were
able
to
see
images
of
the
lengthy
parasite
residing
in
the
small
intestine.
After
sedating
the
man,
a
team
of
physicians
at
the
Institute
of
Liver
and
Biliary
Sciences
Hospital
in
New
Delhi
was
able
to
extract
the
worm
by
pulling
it
through
his
mouth
with
a
pair
of
forceps.
When
removed,
the
tapeworm
measured
6.1
feet
and
was
classified
as
a
Taenia
solium,
otherwise
known
as
a
pork
tapeworm.
According
to
the
Centers
for
Disease
Control
and
Prevention,
a
fully
grown
adult
worm
typically
measures
between
2
and
7
meters
(6.5
to
23
feet)
in
length,
but
there
have
been
cases
reporting
worms
more
than
8
meters
(26
feet)
long.
"We
had
absolutely
no
idea
regarding
the
length
of
this
worm,"
Phillips
said.
"It
kept
on
coming.
"We
pulled
at
it
softly
and
steadily,
and
ultimately
the
job
was
done
after
maybe
around
1
hour
and
15
minutes.
I
have
never
seen
a
tapeworm
this
long
before
this
particular
case."
After
the
procedure,
doctors
prescribed
praziquantel,
a
medication
used
to
treat
parasitic
worm
infections,
to
kill
any
eggs
or
larvae
potentially
remaining
in
the
man's
intestines.
Doctors
advised
the
patient
and
his
family
to
take
deworming
medication
for
the
next
six
months.
Phillips
also
warned
about
potential
food
contamination,
suggesting
the
man
avoid
places
with
poor
sanitation
and
"to
cook
pork
well
at
home
before
consumption."
Pork
tapeworm
infections,
medically
diagnosed
as
cysticercosis,
are
contracted
by
ingesting
tapeworm
eggs.
These
eggs
can
then
spread
through
contaminated
food
and
drinking
water
as
well
as
surfaces
with
contaminated
feces.
