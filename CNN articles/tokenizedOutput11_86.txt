(CNN)2017
has
been
"doubleplusgood"
for
sales
of
George
Orwell's
"1984."The
famed
dystopian
novel
of
life
in
a
totalitarian
state
sat
at
No.
6
on
Amazon's
bestseller
list
Tuesday
morning.
On
Monday,
too,
the
book
hovered
between
No.
5
and
No.
7
on
that
same
bestseller
list,
as
CNN's
Brian
Stelter
noted
in
his
Reliable
Sources
newsletter.
First
published
in
1949
and
imagining
a
future
authoritarian
society,
"1984"
is
widely
regarded
as
one
of
the
most
influential
novels
of
the
20th
century.
Its
state,
Oceania,
employs
a
language
called
Newspeak
(and
words
like
"doubleplusgood")
to
limit
freedom
of
thought.
The
book
focuses
in
particular
on
the
impact
of
omnipresent
government
surveillance
and
the
state's
use
of
propaganda
to
enforce
orthodoxy
to
an
all-powerful
leader,
known
as
"Big
Brother."
The
novel's
newfound
popularity
comes
several
days
after
White
House
press
secretary
Sean
Spicer
argued
defiantly
that
Trump's
swearing-in
Friday
drew
the
largest-ever
audience
for
an
inauguration
"period,"
despite
obvious
photo
and
statistical
evidence
to
the
contrary.
Senior
Trump
adviser
Kellyanne
Conway
later
defended
that
argument
by
saying
Spicer's
false
claims
were
actually
"alternative
facts."
That
phrasing
was
reminiscent
of
Orwell's
"Ministry
of
Truth,"
which,
he
wrote,
concerns
itself
with
"lies."
The
book's
bestseller
status
isn't
necessarily
just
due
to
Team
Trump,
as
"1984"
remains
required
reading
in
most
schools.
The
Amazon
bestseller
list
is
updated
hourly,
so
"1984's"
time
near
the
top
may
not
last
long.
It
currently
sits
just
after
Connor
Franta's
"Note
to
Self"
and
before
Margot
Lee
Shetterly's
"Hidden
Figures."
This
isn't
the
first
time
"1984"
has
seen
a
sales
spike
in
recent
years.
The
book
also
hit
Amazon's
bestseller
list
in
2013
after
Edward
Snowden
revealed
the
extent
of
the
National
Security
Agency's
surveillance
program.
Publisher
printing
more
copies
of
George
Orwell's
'1984'
after
spike
in
demand.
