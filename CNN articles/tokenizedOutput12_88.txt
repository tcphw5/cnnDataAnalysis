(CNN)A
flat-pack
refugee
shelter
developed
by
Ikea
and
the
United
Nations
has
been
named
the
best
design
of
2016.
Awarded
the
Beazley
Design
of
the
Year
award,
presented
by
the
Design
Museum
in
London,
the
modular
Better
Shelter
is
made
from
recyclable
plastic,
comprises
only
68
components,
and
can
be
assembled
in
as
few
as
four
hours.
Each
structure
is
large
enough
to
house
a
family
of
five,
and
includes
a
solar
panel
to
power
lights
and
charge
devices.
Since
production
started
in
2015,
16,000
units
have
been
delivered
to
countries
around
the
world
including
Iraq,
Djibouti,
Greece
and
Niger,
to
be
used
as
homes,
temporary
clinics
and
offices.
"Better
Shelter
tackles
one
of
the
defining
issues
of
the
moment:
providing
shelter
in
an
exceptional
situation
whether
caused
by
violence
or
disaster,"
said
juror
Jana
Scholze,
an
associate
professor
of
curating
contemporary
design
at
Kingston
University,
in
a
statement.

"Providing
not
only
a
design,
but
secure
manufacture
as
well
as
distribution
makes
this
project
relevant
and
even
optimistic.
It
shows
the
power
of
design
to
respond
to
the
conditions
we
are
in
and
transform
them."
The
shelter
triumphed
over
more
eye-catching
nominees,
including
an
Adidas
running
shoe
made
of
recycled
plastic
retrieved
from
the
ocean;
Grafton
Architects'
Universidad
de
Ingeniería
y
Tecnología
building
in
Lima,
Peru,
which
won
the
2016
RIBA
International
Prize;
and
Herzog
&
de
Meuron's
new
addition
to
London's
Tate
Modern.
This
isn't
the
first
time
that
social
impact
has
won
out
over
glamour
for
the
top
prize.
Last
year,
a
microchip-like
device
that
can
mimic
the
functions
of
human
organs
beat
out
Google's
self-driving
car,
Fondation
Louis
Vuitton's
Frank
Gehry-designed
museum,
and
a
Star
Wars-inspired
runway
collection
by
Rodarte,
among
other
entries.
