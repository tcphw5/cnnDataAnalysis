(CNN)Two
senior
administration
officials
said
Thursday
that
the
Trump
administration
told
four
top
State
Department
management
officials
that
their
services
were
no
longer
needed
as
part
of
an
effort
to
"clean
house"
at
Foggy
Bottom.
Patrick
Kennedy,
who
served
for
nine
years
as
the
undersecretary
for
management,
Assistant
Secretaries
for
Administration
and
Consular
Affairs
Joyce
Anne
Barr
and
Michele
Bond,
and
Ambassador
Gentry
Smith,
director
of
the
Office
for
Foreign
Missions,
were
sent
letters
by
the
White
House
that
their
service
was
no
longer
required,
the
sources
told
CNN.
All
four,
career
officers
serving
in
positions
appointed
by
the
President,
submitted
letters
of
resignation
per
tradition
at
the
beginning
of
a
new
administration.

The
letters
from
the
White
House
said
that
their
resignations
were
accepted
and
they
were
thanked
for
their
service.
The
White
House
usually
asks
career
officials
in
such
positions
to
stay
on
for
a
few
months
until
their
successors
are
confirmed.
"Any
implication
that
that
these
four
people
quit
is
wrong,"
one
senior
State
Department
official
said.
"These
people
are
loyal
to
the
secretary,
the
President
and
to
the
State
Department.
There
is
just
not
any
attempt
here
to
dis
the
President.
People
are
not
quitting
and
running
away
in
disgust.
This
is
the
White
House
cleaning
house."
Mark
Toner,
the
State
Department's
acting
spokesman,
said
in
a
statement
that
"These
positions
are
political
appointments,
and
require
the
President
to
nominate
and
the
Senate
to
confirm
them
in
these
roles.
They
are
not
career
appointments
but
of
limited
term."
He
continued,
"Of
the
officers
whose
resignations
were
accepted,
some
will
continue
in
the
Foreign
Service
in
other
positions,
and
others
will
retire
by
choice
or
because
they
have
exceeded
the
time
limits
of
their
grade
in
service."
Greg
Starr,
director
of
diplomatic
security,
also
followed
through
on
his
planned
resignation.
He
had
come
back
from
retirement
after
the
2012
attack
on
the
US
consulate
in
Benghazi
and
promised
to
stay
through
the
end
of
the
Obama
administration.
"This
had
been
on
course
for
over
a
year,"
another
official
said.
"He
came
out
of
retirement
and
promised
to
stay
out
(of)
the
administration.
If
Hillary
Clinton
or
Bernie
Sanders
were
elected,
he
would
still
be
retiring."

The
firings
leave
a
huge
management
hole
at
the
State
Department,
with
a
combined
150
years
of
institutional
experience
among
all
of
the
named
officials.
The
second
official
echoed
that
the
move
appeared
to
be
an
effort
by
the
new
administration
to
"clean
house"
among
the
State
Department's
top
leadership.
Victoria
Nuland,
the
State
Department's
assistant
secretary
for
Europe,
left
on
her
own.
"The
department
will
not
collapse,"
the
second
official
said.
"Everyone
has
good
deputies.
It's
a
huge
institutional
loss,
but
the
department
has
excellent
subordinates
and
the
career
people
will
step
up.
They
will
take
up
the
responsibility."
In
her
parting
letter,
Bond
told
her
colleagues,
"It
has
been
an
honor
to
serve
with
you
as
the
Assistant
Secretary
for
the
past
17
months,
and
to
have
represented
the
United
States
as
a
Foreign
Service
officer
for
40
years.
What
a
privilege
it
has
been."
The
American
Foreign
Service
Association
indicated
in
a
statement
that
it
sees
many
worthy
career
State
Department
employees
as
suitable
replacements.
"The
skills
that
are
needed
for
these
positions
are
exceedingly
rare
outside
the
Foreign
Service.
Given
the
talent
available
in
our
diplomatic
corps,
we
expect
that
the
new
secretary
will
have
no
trouble
finding
the
right
people
at
State
to
fill
out
his
senior
leadership
team,"
the
group
said.
