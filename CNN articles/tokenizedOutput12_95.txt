"Today
beloved
icon
Mary
Tyler
Moore
passed
away
at
the
age
of
80
in
the
company
of
friends
and
her
loving
husband
of
over
33
years,
Dr.
S.
Robert
Levine,"
she
said.
"A
groundbreaking
actress,
producer,
and
passionate
advocate
for
the
Juvenile
Diabetes
Research
Foundation,
Mary
will
be
remembered
as
a
fearless
visionary
who
turned
the
world
on
with
her
smile."
"The
Mary
Tyler
Moore
Show"
debuted
in
1970
and
starred
the
actress
as
Mary
Richards,
a
single
30-something
career
woman
at
a
Minneapolis
TV
station.
The
series
was
hailed
by
feminists
and
fans
alike
as
the
first
modern
woman's
sitcom.
But
that
wasn't
the
role
which
catapulted
her
into
stardom.
Moore
first
found
fame
playing
Laura
Petrie,
the
wife
on
the
"The
Dick
Van
Dyke
Show,"
which
ran
for
five
seasons
beginning
in
1961.
In
an
interview
with
Conan
O'Brien,
show
creator
Carl
Reiner
said
he
auditioned
more
than
two
dozen
actresses
before
Moore's
reading
marked
her
as
the
only
one
who
could
play
Laura.
"I
grabbed
the
top
of
her
head
and
I
said
'Come
with
me,'"
Reiner
told
O'Brien.
"I
walked
her
down
the
hall
to
[Show
producer
Sheldon
Leonard]
and
said,
'I
found
her!'"
Hollywood
mourned
her
loss
on
Wednesday.
"My
heart
goes
out
to
you
and
your
family.
Know
that
I
love
you
and
believe
in
your
strength,"
said
former
co-star
Ed
Asner
on
Twitter.
"Mary
Tyler
Moore
changed
the
world
for
all
women.
I
send
my
love
to
her
family,"
tweeted
Ellen
DeGeneres.
Moore
was
born
in
1936
in
Brooklyn,
New
York,
to
clerk
George
Tyler
Moore
and
his
wife,
Marjorie.
When
she
was
still
a
young
girl
the
family,
which
included
her
two
younger
siblings,
moved
to
Los
Angeles.
Moore
would
later
reveal
that
her
mother
was
an
alcoholic,
which
caused
the
household
to
be
chaotic.
Moore
began
her
career
as
a
dancer
and
in
the
1950s
landed
a
gig
as
dancing
elf
Happy
Hotpoint,
on
a
series
of
Hotpoint
appliances
TV
commercials
which
ran
during
"The
Adventures
of
Ozzie
and
Harriet"
television
show.
Her
dancer
legs
led
to
her
being
cast
as
Sam,
the
sexy
answering
service
girl,
on
the
TV
show
"Richard
Diamond,
Private
Detective
"in
1957.
Moore's
legs
were
shown,
but
never
her
face.
Fans
would
come
to
love
that
face
on
"The
Dick
Van
Dyke
Show,"
and
Moore
quickly
was
dubbed
America's
sweetheart.
The
role
earned
her
two
Emmys.
After
that
show
ended
in
1966,
Moore
looked
to
working
more
on
the
big
screen,
including
opposite
Elvis
Presley
in
the
1969
film
"Change
of
Habit."
'The
Mary
Tyler
Moore
Show'
years
The
next
year
"The
Mary
Tyler
Moore
Show"
premiered.
The
opening
sequence,
featuring
Moore
twirling
and
tossing
her
cap,
became
iconic.
The
show
ended
in
1977,
but
spurred
several
spinoffs,
including
"Rhoda,"
and
"The
Lou
Grant
Show."
In
a
2002
interview
with
CNN's
Larry
King,
Moore
explained
why
she
believed
the
series
became
so
popular.
"I
think
I
can
take
responsibility
for
that
in
that
I
was
the
audience,"
she
said.
"I
was
the
voice
of
sanity
around
whom
all
these
crazies
did
their
dance.
And
I
reacted
in
the
same
way
that
a
member
of
the
audience
would
have
reacted."
In
real
life,
Moore
was
not
a
single
woman.
In
1955,
she
married
Richard
Carleton
Meeker
and
the
following
year
gave
birth
to
their
son,
Richard
Jr.
The
couple
divorced
in
1961
and
the
following
year
she
married
CBS
executive
Grant
Tinker.
While
their
union
didn't
produce
any
children,
it
did
give
birth
to
television
production
company
MTM
Enterprises,
which
produced
"The
Mary
Tyler
Moore
Show"
as
well
as
such
acclaimed
series
as
"The
Bob
Newhart
Show,"
"Hill
Street
Blues"
and
"St.
Elsewhere."
Moore
and
Tinker
divorced
in
1981,
a
year
after
her
son
died
after
accidentally
shooting
himself
while
handling
a
shotgun.
She
said
problems
with
alcohol
helped
to
contribute
to
the
demise
of
her
marriage
to
Tinker.
"We
would
have
inane
arguments
over
dinner
about
things
I
couldn't
remember
the
next
day,"
Moore
told
the
National
Ledger.
"Alcoholism
brings
to
the
fore
hostilities
and
resentment
--
you
can't
have
a
marriage
like
that."
Love
again,
and
an
Oscar
nod
In
1983,
Moore
married
Dr.
Robert
Levine.
While
she
was
beloved
as
a
comedic
actress,
Moore
also
found
success
in
dramas.
Critics
praised
her
against-type
performance
as
a
chilly
mother
whose
family
grapples
with
the
accidental
death
of
a
son
in
Robert
Redford's
1980
film
"Ordinary
People,"
for
which
Moore
was
nominated
for
an
Oscar.
She
worked
in
theater
and
periodically
appeared
on
TV
shows
in
recent
years,
including
"Hot
in
Cleveland,"
where
she
was
reunited
with
"The
Mary
Tyler
Moore
Show"
co-stars
Betty
White
and
Valerie
Harper.
Moore
was
diagnosed
with
Type
1
diabetes
in
her
30s
and
had
numerous
health
issues
over
the
years,
including
complications
from
that
disease
and
brain
surgery
to
remove
a
meningioma
tumor
in
2011.
