(CNN)An
Iranian
infant
with
a
heart
defect
is
entangled
in
President
Trump's
immigration
ban
--
and
her
extended
family
in
Oregon
is
on
an
urgent
mission
to
get
her
to
the
US
for
critical
surgery.
Fatemeh's
parents
were
scheduled
to
meet
with
doctors
in
Portland
on
February
5,
but
were
barred
from
traveling
from
Tehran
to
Portland,
Fatemeh's
uncle,
Samad
Teghizadeh,
told
CNN
Thursday.
Last
month,
Iranian
doctors
in
Tehran
told
baby
Fatemeh's
family
that
the
4-month-old
has
structural
abnormalities
and
two
holes
in
her
heart,
but
they
lack
the
resources
to
treat
the
infant.
Fatemeh
and
her
parents
boarded
a
flight
to
Dubai
on
Saturday
but
they
were
rerouted
back
to
Iran
and
told
to
reapply
for
a
US
visa
in
90
days.
Teghizadeh,
a
US
citizen
who
lives
in
Portland,
worries
his
niece
will
not
make
it
until
then.
The
delay
comes
after
Trump's
executive
order
put
an
abrupt
stop
on
travel
to
the
US
for
citizens
of
seven
Muslim-majority
countries,
including
Iran.
A
call
for
help
Many
state
and
federal
officials
have
intervened
on
behalf
of
the
family,
a
Washington,
D.C.-based
immigration
attorney
working
on
the
case,
Amber
Murray
told
CNN.
Murray
is
helping
the
family
obtain
an
emergency
waiver
to
navigate
around
the
ban.
If
the
waiver
fails,
the
family
could
consider
applying
on
a
humanitarian
basis
which
could
take
30-90
days,
Murray
advised.
Lawyers
involved
with
the
case
are
working
with
State
Department
officials
to
see
if
that
could
be
expedited,
should
the
waiver
not
be
granted,
Murray
said.
"I'm
very
concerned,"
Oregon
Gov.
Kate
Brown
said
in
a
press
conference
Thursday.
"I
find
it
deplorable
that
an
infant,
who
was
supposed
to
come
to
Oregon
to
receive
much
needed
lifesaving
care,
was
not
able
to
access
that
care
at
Oregon
Health
Sciences
University."
The
governor's
office
has
connected
with
the
family
to
determine
if
medical
help
can
be
provided,
spokesman
for
Gov.
Brown,
Bryan
Hockaday,
told
CNN.
Fatemeh's
family
also
contacted
Oregon
Sen.
Jeff
Merkley's
office
asking
for
help.
Sen.
Merkley
hopes
to
use
whatever
leverage
he
has
to
help,
he
"has
taken
interest
in
the
case
and
assigned
a
case
worker
from
his
office
to
work
as
a
facilitator
between
the
family
and
immigration
lawyers,"
Hottman
told
CNN.
"He's
involved
and
very
personally
interested
in
this
issue,
being
very
opposed
to
this
ban
as
its
having
potentially
devastating
effect
on
lives,"
Hottman
said.
The
surgery
Doctors
from
around
the
country,
also
from
Canada
and
Germany,
have
responded
to
calls
for
help,
Murray
told
CNN.
"She
has
a
fairly
complicated
anatomy
with
a
muscular
VSD,"
Murray
said.
A
ventricular
septal
defect
(VSD),
is
a
common
heart
defect
present
at
birth
due
to
an
abnormal
connection
between
the
ventricles
or
lower
chambers
of
the
heart,
according
to
the
Mayo
Clinic.
Doctors
are
awaiting
more
of
Fatemeh's
medical
records
but
in
addition
to
having
a
VSD,
the
initial
diagnosis
indicates
she
also
has
other
heart
complications
including
an
atrial
septal
defect
--
a
"hole"
in
the
wall
that
separates
the
top
two
chambers
of
the
heart.
Fatemeh's
family
is
hoping
a
doctor
will
perform
the
surgeries
pro-bono.
Doctors
in
Tehran
sent
the
results
of
Fatemeh's
echocardiogram
to
doctors
in
Portland
who
reviewed
her
case
said
she
needs
to
be
operated
on
urgently,
projecting
that
while
Fatemeh
has
a
long
road
ahead
--
at
least
two
surgeries
will
be
necessary
to
fix
the
holes
in
her
heart
--
her
chance
for
survival
is
much
higher
in
the
US.
Teghizadeh,
who
has
been
an
American
citizen
for
seven
years,
lives
with
his
parents
in
Portland
--
Fatemeh's
grandparents
--
who
are
also
US
citizens.
"This
is
my
home.
We
live
here.
My
work
and
everything
is
in
the
US,"
he
aid.
"Believe
me,
if
I
didn't
have
a
brother
and
sister
in
Iran,
I
wouldn't
go
there.
This
is
our
home."
Teghizadeh
just
wants
his
sister's
baby
to
get
the
care
she
needs.
