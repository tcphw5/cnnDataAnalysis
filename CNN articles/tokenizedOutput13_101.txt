(CNN)President-elect
Donald
Trump
is
ready
to
"get
the
show
going."
Everything
you
need
to
know
Will
it
rain
on
Trump's
parade?CNN's
Jim
Acosta,
Deirdre
Walsh,
MJ
Lee
and
Dana
Bash
contributed
to
this
report.Less
than
24
hours
before
he
is
inaugurated
as
the
45th
President
of
the
United
States,
Trump
told
supporters
at
a
luncheon
at
his
Washington
hotel
Thursday
that
he
is
preparing
to
use
the
presidential
pen
to
sign
some
"very
meaningful"
documents.
"We
will
be
signing
some
papers
that
will
be
very
meaningful
tomorrow
right
after
the
speech
to
get
the
show
going,"
Trump
said,
according
to
cell
phone
video
of
his
remarks
during
a
closed
press
portion
of
the
luncheon
obtained
by
CNN.
The
remarks
came
hours
after
the
President-elect's
incoming
White
House
Press
Secretary
Sean
Spicer
said
Trump
is
planning
to
sign
a
series
of
executive
orders
beginning
Friday,
though
Spicer
said
Trump
is
"still
working
through
which
ones
he
wants
to
deal
with
tomorrow
versus
Monday
or
Tuesday."
"The
President-elect
is
continuing
to
get
briefed
on
some
of
the
orders
he
wants
to
do
and
the
sequencing
thereof,"
Spicer
said.
"I
think
you'll
see
some
activity
on
both
tomorrow,
over
the
weekend
and
then
Monday,
Tuesday,
Wednesday."
Trump
aides
have
said
that
Trump
will
sign
ceremonial
and
logistical
executive
orders
on
Friday,
but
have
also
left
the
door
open
to
more
policy-oriented
actions
and
announcements
in
Trump's
first
12
hours
in
office.
Advisers
are
preparing
for
announcements
on
a
variety
of
fronts
--
Friday,
into
the
weekend
and
early
next
week
--
whenever
Trump
gives
the
signal.
Obamacare,
the
fight
against
ISIS,
immigration
and
a
lobbying
ban
are
high
on
the
list
of
early
executive
orders,
Spicer
said
Thursday
morning.
A
senior
GOP
Hill
aide
said
lawmakers
anticipate
that
Trump
will
roll
out
multiple
executive
orders
related
to
Obamacare.
But
the
stresses
they
have
not
yet
been
briefed
or
given
any
heads-up
about
what
is
coming.
The
President-elect
had
previously
suggested
that
the
work
of
his
administration
will
begin
in
earnest
on
Monday
--
and
not
before.
"Day
one
--
which
I
will
consider
to
be
Monday
as
opposed
to
Friday
or
Saturday,
right?
I
mean,
my
day
one
is
going
to
be
Monday
because
I
don't
want
to
be
signing
and
get
it
mixed
up
with
lots
of
celebration,"
Trump
said
in
an
interview
with
the
UK's
Times
of
London
and
Germany's
Bild
newspapers.
Trump's
advisers
have
sought
to
dispel
that
notion,
with
Spicer
insisting
repeatedly
that
Trump
and
his
administration
will
hit
the
ground
running
on
Friday
after
Trump
is
inaugurated
at
noon
and
work
through
the
weekend.
Executive
action
The
moment
Trump
is
sworn
into
office,
some
of
his
aides
will
start
moving
into
the
White
House,
Trump
transition
officials
told
CNN.
Some
of
his
advisers
will
even
watch
Trump
deliver
his
inaugural
address
from
inside
the
West
Wing.
The
timing
of
executive
orders
is
likely
to
be
fluid.
One
adviser
said
executive
orders
or
White
House
announcements
could
be
put
out
in
order
to
"change
the
conversation,"
in
case
anti-Trump
protests
or
other
rumblings
steer
attention
away
from
Trump.
Agency
officials
are
likely
to
be
no
more
informed
of
any
executive
actions
as
most
Americans
until
they
hit
TV
screens
and
news
sites.
One
current
administration
official
said
Trump
transition
officials
have
not
engaged
with
the
Department
of
Health
and
Human
Services
about
what
heath
care-related
executive
orders
might
fall.
"I
don't
know
what
we're
rolling
out
on
Monday.
Makes
me
a
little
nervous,"
the
official,
who
has
been
through
multiple
transitions,
said.
Trump
on
the
campaign
trail
vowed
a
flurry
of
action
on
his
first
day
as
president,
including
a
pledge
to
"cancel
immediately
all
illegal
and
overreaching
executive
orders."
Trump
also
vowed
he
would
impose
a
"moratorium
on
new
agency
regulations"
across
the
federal
government.
During
the
campaign,
the
Republican
frequently
boasted
that
while
he
did
not
like
Obama's
executive
orders,
he
would
at
least
have
the
power
to
undo
them
as
president.
"If
I
get
elected,
many
of
those
executive
orders
that
he
signed,
the
first
day,
they're
going
to
be
unsigned,"
Trump
said
in
an
interview
with
NBC's
"Meet
the
Press"
last
January.
