world
as
it
unfolds.Mogadishu,
Somalia
(CNN)Extremist
group
Al-Shabaab
claimed
responsibility
for
two
explosions
Wednesday
that
police
say
killed
at
least
21
people
and
rocked
the
Somali
capital.CNN's
Julia
Jones
contributed
to
this
report.At
least
50
people
were
injured
in
the
attack,
said
Capt.
Abukar
Osman
with
the
Somali
Police
Force.
Among
the
injured
are
seven
journalists,
according
to
Hussein
Ali,
an
official
of
Mogadishu's
ambulance
services.
Four
Al-Shabaab
militants
involved
in
the
attack
also
died,
Osman
said.
Attackers
detonated
a
truck
bomb
outside
the
gates
of
the
Dayah
Hotel
--
which
is
near
the
country's
Parliament
building
and
popular
with
lawmakers
and
government
officials
--
before
storming
inside,
Somali
police
Maj.
Ahmed
Ibrahim
told
CNN.
A
second
truck
exploded
nearby
15
minutes
later,
Ibrahim
said.
As
of
mid-evening,
the
gunfire
had
stopped
and
security
forces
were
able
to
retake
control
of
the
hotel,
Osman
said.
Ali
Hajji,
the
head
nurse
at
the
nearby
Hayad
hospital,
said
the
death
toll
is
likely
to
rise.
Al-Shabaab,
an
al
Qaeda-linked
terror
group
that
seeks
to
turn
the
country
into
a
fundamentalist
Islamic
state,
has
carried
out
repeated
attacks
against
the
government
and
military
targets.
One
of
the
world's
poorest
countries,
Somalia
descended
into
civil
war
after
dictator
Siad
Barre's
ouster
in
1991.
Rival
clan
leaders
and
extremist
groups
such
as
Al-Shabaab
took
advantage
of
the
power
vacuum.
The
groups
subsequently
grew
in
size
and
strength.
Al-Shabaab
has
seen
its
power
wane
in
recent
years,
thanks
in
part
to
an
African
Union
coalition
dedicated
to
peacekeeping
in
the
country.
But
Mogadishu
is
subject
to
attacks
on
a
frequent
basis.
Most
recently,
a
car
bomb
killed
20
people
in
December.
