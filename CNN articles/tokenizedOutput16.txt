(CNN)A
full
week
has
passed
since
President
Donald
Trump
said
he
would
sign
an
executive
order
opening
a
Justice
Department
investigation
into
his
unsubstantiated
claim
that
millions
of
people
voted
illegally
in
November.The
Oval
Office
signing
was
abruptly
canceled
last
Thursday
and
never
rescheduled.
The
White
House
hasn't
talked
about
it
since.
The
President
has
moved
on
to
other
subjects.
A
senior
administration
official
told
CNN
that
the
voter
fraud
investigation
is
no
longer
a
top
priority
for
the
President,
insisting
it's
not
off
the
table,
but
not
expected
anytime
soon.
The
President
has
repeatedly
claimed
without
evidence
that
3
to
5
million
people
--
mainly
undocumented
immigrants
--
committed
voter
fraud
in
his
race
with
Hillary
Clinton.
He
lost
the
popular
vote
to
Clinton
by
nearly
3
million
votes.
For
days,
the
allegations
overshadowed
his
message.
Republican
congressional
leaders
privately
urged
him
to
drop
the
matter,
which
escalated
after
Trump
declared
last
week
on
Twitter:
"I
will
be
asking
for
a
major
investigation
into
VOTER
FRAUD,
including
those
registered
to
vote
in
two
states,
those
who
are
illegal
and
...
even,
those
registered
to
vote
who
are
dead
(and
many
for
a
long
time)."
Trump
was
set
to
sign
the
action
last
Thursday
afternoon.
Reporters
and
photographers
were
summoned
to
the
West
Wing
to
document
the
signing,
but
waited
for
about
30
minutes
amid
confusion
from
aides.
At
the
time,
White
House
press
secretary
Sean
Spicer
said
the
President
"got
jammed
up
on
some
meetings
that
needed
to
occur."
Spicer
said
the
order
would
be
signed
in
the
next
day
or
two.
One
aide
said
the
President
is
waiting
until
Sen.
Jeff
Sessions
is
confirmed
as
attorney
general
before
launching
an
investigation.
But
others
inside
the
West
Wing
hope
the
President
doesn't
pursue
it,
CNN
has
learned.
"I
think
there
will
be
something
signed,"
one
senior
administration
said,
"but
I
don't
think
it
will
be
now."
