for

which
killed
nine
police
officers.
Is
genocide
unfolding
in
Myanmar?
Fighting
back
In
his
first
ever
interview
with
the
media,
the
group's
leader,
Atah
Ullah,
says
they
decided
to
fight
back
against
the
government
after
70
years
of
repression.
"We,
the
vulnerable
and
persecuted
people,
have
asked
the
international
community
for
protection
against
the
atrocities
by
the
government
of
Myanmar,
but
the
international
community
turned
its
back
on
us,"
Atah
Ullah
says
in
an
exclusive
interview
obtained
by
CNN.
"Finally,
we
cannot
take
it
anymore."
An
estimated
one
million
Muslim
Rohingyas
live
in
Rakhine
State,
where
they
are
a
persecuted,
stateless
ethnic
minority
in
Buddhist-majority
Myanmar.
The
government
of
Myanmar,
also
known
as
Burma,
does
not
officially
recognize
the
Rohingya,
regarding
them
as
illegal
immigrants
from
neighboring
Bangladesh,
despite
many
being
able
to
trace
their
roots
back
in
Myanmar
for
generations.
"In
the
October
9th
attack,
we
did
not
have
any
sophisticated
weapons,"
Atah
Ullah
says.
"We
attacked
them
using
our
machetes,
swords,
and
knives,
and
we
seized
their
weapons
to
use
against
them."
In
response,
the
Myanmar
military
launched
what
it
calls
"clearance
operations"
in
the
Rohingya
villages
to
find
the
suspects
involved
in
the
attack,
and
to
retrieve
their
weapons.
In
early
November,
the
military
deployed
helicopters
which
opened
fire
during
clashes
with
Rohingya
militants.
State
media
reports
that
in
the
process,
more
than
100
Rohingyas
described
as
"violent
attackers"
have
been
killed,
although
activists
tell
CNN
the
number
is
far
higher.
Nearly
500
Rohingyas
have
also
been
arrested.
To
escape
the
violence,
at
least
69,000
people
have
fled
across
the
border
to
Bangladesh,
the
latest
figures
from
the
UN's
Office
for
the
Coordination
of
Humanitarian
Affairs
(UNOCHA)
show.
Tales
of
misery
Many
of
the
refugees
arriving
in
Bangladesh,
including
several
who
spoke
to
CNN,
have
reported
mass
killings,
rapes
and
burning
of
villages
by
government
forces.
"The
military
took
away
my
son,"
says
Hamid
Hossain,
a
refugee
in
Teknaf,
Bangladesh.
"The
military
took
away
89
boys
from
our
villages."
"The
military
has
been
torturing
us
since
2012.
They
are
killing
Rohingyas
and
raping
women,"
he
says.
CNN
cannot
independently
verify
the
accounts
from
inside
Rakhine
State,
because
access
to
journalists
and
aid
agencies
is
heavily
restricted.
Amnesty
International
says
the
government's
actions
"may
amount
to
crimes
against
humanity."
Yanghee
Lee,
the
UN
Special
Rapporteur
on
Human
Rights,
visited
Myanmar
last
month
and
said
she
saw
with
her
"own
eyes"
the
burnt
houses
in
Rakhine
State.
In
a
news
conference
in
Yangon
at
the
end
of
the
trip,
she
concluded
that
if
the
population
felt
like
the
new
government
was
"addressing
their
situation,"
then
"extreme
elements
would
not
have
easily
been
able
to
hijack
their
cause."
She
added
that
the
government's
response
seems
to
be
to
"defend,
dismiss
and
deny,"
and
is
"counterproductive."
In
a
4,000-word
written
statement
to
CNN,
Myanmar
government
spokesperson
Aye
Aye
Soe
denies
human
rights
abuses.
"What
is
happening
in
Rakhine
now
is
only
security
clearance
sweeps
being
carried
out
with
restraint
and
within
rules
and
regulations
against
armed
perpetrators,"
Aye
Aye
Soe
says.
"The
instigators
are
using
this
situation
to
portray
a
disproportionate
picture
of
'genocide'
and
'ethnic
cleansing.'"
'Immediate
action'
The
government
has
acknowledged
wrongdoing
in
one
incident,
after
a
video
emerged
of
a
Myanmar
police
officer
kicking
a
Rohingya
man
in
the
face.
"The
government
took
immediate
action
against
the
responsible
police
personnel
for
acting
on
emotion
and
against
rules
and
regulation,"
Aye
Aye
Soe
says.
Atah
Ullah
says
the
video
is
one
of
many
examples
of
police
brutality
during
the
recent
government
crackdown.
"We
are
not
embedded
in
Rohingya
communities,"
he
says.
"But
the
government
is
using
false
propaganda
to
commit
atrocities."
Atah
Ullah
insists
that
al-Yaqeen
are
not
"terrorists,"
saying
they
will
never
attack
civilians.
"Atrocity,
violence,
and
injustice
against
any
innocent
civilians
is
not
in
the
principles
or
policy
of
al-Yaqeen,"
he
says.
"It
is
not
in
our
moral
values
to
cause
harm
to
innocent
Burmese
Buddhists
or
Rakhine
people."
Their
only
target,
Ullah
says,
are
government
forces.
"We
will
continue
to
attack
the
oppressor,
the
government,
until
our
citizenship
is
reinstated,"
Ullah
says.
"We
appeal
to
the
international
community
to
help
us
in
reclaiming
our
rights,
so
that
we
will
not
have
to
resort
to
bloodshed,
but
until
we
get
all
our
basic
rights
back
we
will
continue
to
fight."
Aye
Aye
Soe
says
there
is
no
excuse
for
the
group's
actions.
"There
should
not
be
any
justification
for
taking
up
arms
against
peaceful
legitimate
governments
and
the
people
of
the
country,"
she
says.
"If
they
are
allowed
to
justify
the
killing
of
police
personnel
...
then
the
sovereign
government
of
the
country
has
a
more
legitimate
right
and
duty
to
protect
the
people,
enforce
law
and
order,
maintain
peace
and
stability
and
rule
of
law."
Atah
Ullah
says
he
feels
no
remorse
for
the
fallout
of
the
October
9
attack,
saying
that
the
Rohingya
people
support
them
because
"it
is
their
hope
and
aspiration
for
reclaiming
all
their
rights."
'Not
a
good
move'
CNN
visited
the
Rohingya
refugee
camps
in
Bangladesh,
to
find
out
how
those
who
have
borne
the
brunt
of
the
violence
feel
about
al-Yaqeen.
"The
leader
is
trying
to
give
freedom
to
the
oppressed
Rohingyas
in
Rakhine
State,"
says
Amir
Hossain,
a
refugee
in
Kutupalong
Camp,
Cox's
Bazar.
"But
they
didn't
have
enough
arms
to
fight
against
the
military.
That's
why
they
could
not
fight
back."
Pormina
Begum,
a
refugee
in
the
Leda
refugee
camp
in
Teknaf,
supports
al-Yaqeen.
"They
(al-Yaqeen)
are
working
to
save
our
dignity,"
Begum
says.
"Maybe
they
have
failed
initially.
But
they
will
be
successful
in
the
future."
Hamid
Hossain,
another
refugee
in
Teknaf,
thinks
the
attack
was
a
bad
idea.
"I
think
it
was
not
a
good
move
by
al-Yaqeen,"
Hossain
tells
CNN.
"Their
attack
on
border
guards
was
a
premature
step."
But,
he
says,
the
conflict
has
at
least
raised
attention
to
their
plight.
"Had
they
not
been
attacked
the
Myanmar
police,
no
one
would
talk
about
the
suffering
of
Rohingyas,"
Hossain
says.
"Now
everyone
knows
about
the
crisis."
Another
refugee,
who
did
not
want
to
be
identified,
said
many
Rohingyas
are
scared
to
disagree
with
al-Yaqeen
for
fear
of
reprisals.
"We
can't
debate
with
al-Yaqeen
members.
If
someone
does,
they
think
he
is
taking
the
side
of
army,"
he
says.
"They
might
even
kill
people
if
anyone
is
suspected
of
supporting
the
government."
"The
sad
situation
is
that
the
community
lives
in
fear
of
both
the
security
forces
and
the
violent
extremists,"
Myanmar
government
spokesperson
Aye
Aye
Soe
says.
'Game
changer'
As
the
humanitarian
crisis
grows
on
both
sides
of
the
border,
there
is
growing
concern
among
security
analysts
about
the
future
of
the
nascent
rebel
movement.
In
a
lengthy
report
released
in
December,
security
experts
at
the
International
Crisis
Group
(ICG)
described
al-Yaqeen
as
a
"game-changer"
for
Myanmar.
"The
threat
is
not
because
of
their
military
strength,
it's
because
of
what
they
represent,
the
potential
of
the
country
facing
a
very
well
organized,
violent
jihadi
movement,"
Richard
Horsey,
the
ICG's
Myanmar
Consultant
tells
CNN.
"It's
clear
that's
not
the
case
so
far,
but
it
seems
that
is
what
the
military
and
government
appear
to
be
worried
about."
Atah
Ullah
insists
al-Yaqeen
does
not
receive
foreign
funding
and
will
never
align
with
terror
groups
such
as
ISIS,
but
Horsey
says
the
group
"could
in
the
future
potentially
be
taken
advantage
of
by
global
jihadist
activists."
The
Rohingyas
have
"never
been
a
radicalized
population,"
with
the
majority
seeing
violence
as
"counterproductive,"
Horsey
says.
"The
fact
that
more
people
are
now
embracing
violence
reflects
deep
policy
failures
over
many
years
rather
than
any
sort
of
inevitability."
Looking
to
The
Lady
The
blame
for
these
apparent
failures
is
partly
being
directed
at
Myanmar
State
Counsellor
Aung
San
Suu
Kyi,
whose
National
League
for
Democracy
party
swept
to
power
in
a
landslide
victory
in
2015.
The
Nobel
Peace
Prize
winner
has
been
criticized
for
not
doing
enough
to
protect
the
Rohingyas.
In
response
she
has
asked
for
more
"time
and
space"
to
resolve
the
problems.
The
government
says
Aung
San
Suu
Kyi's
creation
of
the
Kofi
Annan-led
Rakhine
Commission
in
September,
and
efforts
to
begin
a
new
process
to
give
citizenship
rights
to
the
Rohingya
people,
shows
its
intention
to
resolve
the
problems
in
the
region.
"The
State
Counsellor
has
instructed
the
process
to
continue
in
areas
where
there's
no
opposition
and
to
issue
citizenship
cards
as
soon
as
possible
to
the
Muslims,"
Aye
Aye
Soe
says.
"These
actions
are
a
testimony
of
the
government's
seriousness
to
tackle
this
issue."
Despite
these
assurances,
there
is
still
huge
disappointment
in
the
new
administration
among
Rohingyas.
Under
Myanmar's
constitution,
which
was
written
and
approved
by
the
military
junta
in
2008,
Aung
San
Suu
Kyi
and
her
elected
government
share
authority
with
top
generals,
who
maintain
control
over
large
parts
of
security
policy.
Aye
Aye
Soe
insists
that
the
government
has
the
"full
support"
of
the
military.
But
Atah
Ullah
says
this
power
structure
means
their
dreams
of
change
were
unrealistic.
"We
had
hopes
that
(Suu
Kyi)
would
also
justly
stand
up
for
the
rights
of
the
Rohingya
people,"
he
says.
"Now
it
turns
out
that
the
Myanmar
military
has
completely
controlled
her.
That's
why
we
no
longer
have
confidence
in
her."
"Whatever
respect
and
love
we
had
for
her,
that's
all
gone."
