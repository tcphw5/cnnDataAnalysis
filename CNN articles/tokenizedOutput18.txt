(CNN)The
commitment
of
the
US
and
South
Korea
to
a
new
missile
defense
system
is
pushing
the
Korean
peninsula
to
the
"brink
of
a
nuclear
war,"
North
Korea
warned
Friday.CNN's
Sol
Han
contributed
to
this
report.Pyongyang
said
the
missile
system,
also
opposed
by
China,
was
part
of
a
joint
plot
between
Seoul
and
Washington
to
mount
a
"preemptive
attack
on
the
North",
according
to
a
statement
on
the
official
KCNA
news
agency
attributed
to
the
National
Peace
Committee
of
Korea.
The
statement
coincided
with
a
a
visit
by
new
US
Defense
Secretary
James
Mattis
to
Seoul,
where
he
pledged
to
deploy
THAAD
--
the
Terminal
High
Altitude
Area
Defense
system
--
to
protect
US
and
South
Korean
troops.
Mattis
promised
an
"overwhelming"
response
to
any
attack
mounted
by
North
Korea.
"North
Korea
continues
to
launch
missiles,
develop
its
nuclear
weapons
program
and
engage
in
threatening
rhetoric
and
behavior,"
Mattis
said
at
a
press
conference
in
Seoul
on
Friday.
Speaking
alongside
South
Korean
Defense
Minister
Han
Min-koo,
he
added:
"Any
attack
on
the
United
States
or
on
our
allies
will
be
defeated
and
any
use
of
nuclear
weapons
will
be
met
with
a
response
that
will
be
effective
and
overwhelming."
The
North
Korean
statement
said
THAAD
was
part
of
an
offensive
strategy
between
Seoul
and
Washington,
alleging
the
two
had
"worked
out
a
plan
for
a
preemptive
attack
on
the
North
and
...
desperately
pushed
forward
it,
pushing
the
situation
on
the
peninsula
to
the
brink
of
a
nuclear
war."
On
Thursday
Mattis
said
Pyongyang's
"provocative
behavior"
made
THAAD
necessary.
China
again
called
for
the
THAAD
missile
defense
system
to
be
halted.
In
his
regular
press
conference
on
Friday,
Chinese
Foreign
Ministry
spokesman
Lu
Kang
said
Beijing
"firmly
opposed"
the
new
system.
"This
has
not
changed
and
will
not
change.
Our
position
is
very
clear-cut
and
straight
forward,"
he
said.
"We
believe
that
the
action
by
the
US
and
the
Republic
of
Korea
will
undermine
the
strategic
and
security
interests
of
regional
countries
including
China."
Later
on
Friday,
Mattis
traveled
to
Japan,
which
also
feels
threatened
by
North
Korea's
nuclear
and
missile
programs.
Speaking
in
Tokyo
at
a
meeting
with
Japanese
Prime
Minister
Shinzo
Abe,
Mattis
reaffirmed
Washington's
support.
"I
want
there
to
be
no
misunderstanding
during
the
transition
in
Washington
that
we
stand
firmly,
100
percent
shoulder
to
shoulder
with
you
and
the
Japanese
people,
Mr.
Prime
Minister."
Mattis'
visit
to
the
region
comes
at
a
time
of
relative
quiet
from
Kim
Jong
Un's
regime,
which
hasn't
tested
a
ballistic
missile
since
October
20.
Earlier
in
2016,
it
fired
projectiles
at
a
record
rate.
North
Korea
nevertheless
continues
to
make
bellicose
statements,
including
one
from
leader
Kim
Jong
Un
on
New
Year's
Day
in
which
he
said
his
military
is
on
the
brink
of
testing
its
first
intercontinental
ballistic
missile
--
a
rocket
that
could
be
equipped
with
nuclear
weapons
and
is
powerful
enough
to
reach
any
part
of
the
United
States.
Analysts
point
out,
however,
that
Kim's
bluster
is
often
more
for
internal
consumption
than
an
actual
threat
to
South
Korea
and
the
US,
which
has
28,000
troops
in
South
Korea.
"He
demands
from
his
people
and
subordinates
complete
obedience
to
his
leadership,
because
the
country
is
on
the
verge
of
imminent
invasion
from
the
US
and
South
Korea,"
said
Seung-Kyun
Ko,
a
professor
at
Hawaii
Pacific
University
and
a
former
research
commissioner
in
South
Korea's
Ministry
of
Foreign
Affairs.
"He
creates
cohesion
and
unity
among
his
people
in
facing
the
invasion."
