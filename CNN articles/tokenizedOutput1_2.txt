'Frustrating'
lockdown
Taylor
Walstrum,
a
junior
at
the
University
of
Georgia,
was
visiting
the
Louvre
with
some
of
his
classmates
while
on
a
study
abroad
program
in
Italy
--
and
was
among
those
caught
up
in
the
lockdown.
"We
were
at
the
Mona
Lisa
when
alarms
started
going
off,
and
the
staff
began
frantically
ushering
us
out,"
he
told
CNN
over
Twitter.
He
said
staff
led
people
down
to
the
basement
and
said
police
were
sweeping
the
grounds,
but
didn't
tell
them
what
was
happening.
Then
they
moved
the
group
to
another
room,
where
they
waited
for
two
or
three
hours.
"[We]
weren't
told
anything
other
than
the
inside
of
the
museum
was
secure,
had
to
rely
on
outside
news,
which
was
very
frustrating,"
he
said.
Walstrum
said
that
authorities
searched
their
bags,
and
then
everyone
was
patted
down
by
armed
guards
before
they
were
allowed
to
leave.
"At
which
point
we
were
let
out
of
the
museum
and
allowed
to
roam
free,"
he
said.
"Lots
of
sirens
but
we
got
away
from
there
as
quickly
as
we
could."
As
the
incident
unfolded,
a
music
producer
from
Florida
tweeted
that
"something
is
going
down"
at
the
Louvre,
adding
that
he
saw
"30
National
Police
vehicles
with
guns
drawn."
The
Louvre
said
it
would
reopen
on
Saturday.
State
of
emergency
Voted
the
most
popular
museum
in
the
world
in
2016,
the
Louvre
is
home
to
the
Mona
Lisa,
the
Venus
de
Milo
and
the
Code
of
Hammurabi,
among
other
famous
works.
But
since
a
series
of
terror
attacks
have
plagued
France,
the
number
of
visitors
visiting
the
country
and
touring
the
Parisian
institution
has
fallen.
Louvre
attendance
has
fallen
by
21%
over
the
past
two
years,
with
7.3
million
people
visiting
the
museum
in
2016
compared
to
9.3
million
in
2014.
A
state
of
emergency
has
been
in
place
across
France
since
the
Paris
terror
attacks
in
November
2015,
in
which
130
people
were
killed
and
hundreds
injured.
In
January
that
year,
17
people
were
killed
in
attacks
in
Paris
on
the
satirical
magazine
Charlie
Hebdo
and
at
a
kosher
grocery
store,
and
in
the
Paris
suburb
of
Montrouge.
Last
July,
a
radicalized
Tunisian
plowed
a
20-ton
truck
into
crowds
on
the
Promenade
des
Anglais
in
Nice
during
a
Bastille
Day
celebration,
killing
86
people
and
injuring
200
others.
Authorities
continue
to
monitor
thousands
of
suspected
Islamist
radicals.
