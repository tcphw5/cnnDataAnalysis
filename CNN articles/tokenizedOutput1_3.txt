(CNN)More
than
100,000
visas
have
been
revoked
since
President
Donald
Trump's
executive
order
on
immigration
and
travel
was
signed
on
January
27,
a
lawyer
for
the
Justice
Department
said
Friday
in
a
court
hearing
in
Virginia.Yet
the
State
Department
quickly
disputed
that
number,
telling
CNN
Friday
that
"fewer
than
60,000
individuals'
visas
were
provisionally
revoked
to
comply
with
the
Executive
Order."
The
lawyer's
number
came
in
response
to
a
question
from
the
US
District
Court
Judge
Leonie
Brinkema
about
how
many
people
have
been
affected
by
this
order.
Erez
Reuveni,
of
the
Office
of
Immigration
Litigation
within
the
Civil
Division
of
the
Justice
Department,
also
said
no
returning
legal
permanent
residents
have
been
denied
entry
at
Dulles
International
Airport,
citing
recent
guidance
from
the
White
House
counsel's
office
that
sections
of
Trump's
executive
order
do
not
apply
to
legal
permanent
residents.
Reuveni
said
he
did
not
know
how
many
people
in
total
were
deported
over
the
weekend.
Brinkema
ordered
the
Justice
Department
to
provide
a
list
of
"all
persons
who
have
been
denied
entry
to
or
removed
from
the
United
States,"
since
the
executive
order
was
signed
last
Friday
who
"had
a
residence
in
the
Commonwealth
of
Virginia
and
had
lawful
permanent
resident
status,
an
immigrant
visa
(or
accompanying
family
or
spousal
visa),
a
valid
student
visa
(or
accompanying
family
or
spousal
visa),
or
a
valid
work
visa
(or
accompanying
family
or
spousal
visa)
by
the
close
of
business
on
Thursday,
February
9,
2017."
While
Brinkema
commended
the
government
for
working
on
an
agreement
to
bring
two
of
the
named
plaintiffs
in
the
case
--
Tareq
Aqel
Mohammed
Aziz
and
Ammar
Aqel
Muhammad
Aziz,
who
were
traveling
on
immigrant
visas
but
deported
when
they
arrived
at
Dulles
Saturday
morning
--
back
to
the
US,
she
also
strongly
encouraged
the
government
to
consider
how
it
might
resolve
these
cases
more
"globally."
"I
have
been
on
this
bench
a
long
time
...
I
have
never
seen
such
a
public
outpouring
before,"
Brinkema
said,
adding
that
this
order
"touched
something
in
people
like
I've
never
seen
before."
She
went
on
to
explain
that
she
recognized
that
the
President
has
"almost
unfettered"
discretion
in
the
area
of
immigration,
but
his
power
has
"limits"
and
the
rollout
of
the
executive
order
caused
"chaos"
last
weekend.
"Without
any
kind
of
fact-finding
or
hard
evidence
of
a
need
to
rescind
these
(visa)
decisions,
human
beings
relied
on
these
decisions.
...
I
hope
the
government
gives
serious
thought
about
how
to
address
these
issues."
It's
not
clear
why
there
was
a
discrepancy
between
the
Justice
and
State
Department's
figures.
In
a
statement,
Kevin
Brosnahan,
a
State
Department
spokesman,
provided
the
60,000
figure
and
would
only
say,
"We
recognize
that
those
individuals
are
temporarily
inconvenienced
while
we
conduct
our
review
under
the
Executive
Order.
To
put
that
number
in
context,
we
issued
over
11
million
immigrant
and
non-immigrant
visas
in
fiscal
year
2015."
The
Virginia
Attorney
General's
office
filed
a
contempt
motion
Wednesday
following
news
reports
and
declarations,
including
one
from
Rep.
Donald
S.
Beyer
Jr.,
asserting
that
attorneys
were
denied
access
to
detained
individuals
at
Dulles
airport
in
direct
violation
of
Brinkema's
court
order
issued
Saturday.
But
Brinkema
declined
to
take
up
that
motion
Friday,
saying
she
was
"troubled"
about
any
denial
of
access
to
counsel
but
recognized
that
the
situation
at
Dulles
last
weekend
was
"chaotic
for
everybody."
Counsel
is
not
normally
allowed
in
the
secondary
screening
area,
and
she
did
not
want
to
"stir
up
the
waters
unnecessarily."
The
judge
also
extended
her
previous
temporary
restraining
order
against
removing
lawful
permanent
residents
until
next
Friday.
