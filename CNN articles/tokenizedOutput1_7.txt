(CNN)The
US
military
is
scrambling
to
explain
an
embarrassing
mix-up
after
it
released
video
obtained
from
Sunday's
raid
in
Yemen
that
turned
out
to
have
already
been
published
online.CNN's
Dan
Merica
contributed
to
this
report.A
military
spokesman
acknowledged
it
was
released
without
having
been
thoroughly
analyzed.
The
video
was
meant
to
demonstrate
the
value
of
the
weekend
raid
whose
stated
aim
was
to
recover
key
intelligence
about
al
Qaeda.
But
the
footage
released
Friday
morning
actually
consisted
of
video
that
was
previously
available
to
the
public.
The
video
was
pulled
because
"we
didn't
want
to
make
it
appear
that
we
were
trying
to
pass
off
old
video,"
said
US
Central
Command
spokesman
Col.
John
Thomas.
The
mistake
was
due
"to
our
lack
of
having
time
to
properly
analyze
it."
"We
were
trying
to
provide
an
example
of
some
of
the
things
recovered
on
the
raid,"
Thomas
said.
Thomas
was
adamant
there
was
no
pressure
to
release
anything.
He
insisted
it
was
CENTCOM'S
decision
alone
to
put
out
the
video
and
not
an
order
from
above.
A
second
defense
official
agreed
that
there
was
no
White
House
pressure.
The
official
said
that
the
desire
to
get
this
out
came
from
a
subordinate
Special
Operations
unit
involved
in
the
raid
frustrated
by
the
politicization
and
coverage
of
the
mission.
The
Pentagon
quickly
approved
the
idea
when
broached
by
CENTCOM,
the
official
added.
A
White
House
official
told
CNN
it
was
not
involved
in
the
Pentagon's
decision
to
release
video
of
the
January
raid
in
Yemen.
The
video
that
was
released
is
nine
years
old,
according
to
US
CENTCOM
officials.
But
the
military
said
the
footage,
even
if
not
fresh,
was
still
of
value.
"It
does
not
matter
when
the
video
was
made.
It
is
still
illustrative
of
who
they
are
and
what
their
intentions
are,"
said
Capt.
Jeff
Davis,
Pentagon
spokesman.
Ahead
of
the
botched
video
release,
Thomas
had
said
that
"the
videos
are
one
example
of
the
volumes
of
sensitive
al
Qaeda
terror-planning
information
recovered
during
the
operation."
He
added,
"What
was
captured
from
the
site
has
already
afforded
insights
into
al
Qaeda
leadership,
AQAP
(Al
Qaeda
of
the
Arabian
Peninsula)
methods
of
exporting
terror,
and
how
they
communicate."
CENTCOM
said
the
remainder
of
the
recovered
information
will
remain
classified.
President
Donald
Trump
will
visit
US
Central
Command
at
MacDill
Air
Force
Base
in
Florida
on
Monday,
White
House
Press
Secretary
Sean
Spicer
announced
Friday.
He
said
the
President
will
receive
briefings
from
military
officials
there
and
deliver
an
"all
hands"
address
to
US
troops.
Post-raid
analysis
has
determined
that
several
of
the
14
AQAP
operatives
killed
in
the
raid
were
terrorist
network
leaders
and
facilitators,
according
to
CENTCOM.
The
dead
include
Sultan
al
Dhahab
and
Abd-al-Ra'uf
al-Dhahab,
two
longstanding
AQAP
operational
planners
and
weapons
experts.
An
official
at
Central
Command,
which
oversees
US
military
operations
in
the
Middle
East,
described
the
clips
as
excerpts
from
"al
Qaeda
terrorist
training
videos,"
saying
the
release
offers
"a
first
look"
at
what
the
military
recovered.
The
information
was
seized
from
a
staging
area,
propaganda
center
and
logistics
hub
for
AQAP's
terrorist
network
this
past
weekend.
The
military
said
the
operation,
known
as
a
"site
exploitation"
raid,
was
geared
toward
collecting
as
much
intelligence
on
the
terror
group
as
possible
to
facilitate
future
raids
and
strikes
against
al
Qaeda
and
prevent
terror
attacks
around
the
world.
In
the
wake
of
the
Obama
administration's
raid
that
killed
al
Qaeda
founder
Osama
bin
Laden,
the
military
released
videos
that
were
among
the
trove
of
documents
and
computers
seized
in
that
operation.
The
release
of
the
new
video
clips
comes
as
news
has
emerged
regarding
how
the
raid
was
authorized
during
the
first
days
of
Trump's
presidency.
Former
National
Security
Council
staff
under
President
Barack
Obama
criticized
what
they
said
were
the
Trump
White
House's
attempts
to
attribute
the
operation's
approval
to
the
previous
administration.
The
raid
left
one
Navy
SEAL
dead,
three
wounded
and
led
to
civilian
casualties.
Trump
provided
final
approval
for
the
raid
because
it
required
a
presidential
green
light,
but
it
was
months
in
the
making
and
was
okayed
at
several
levels
before
getting
to
the
President's
desk.
Trump
staffers,
military
officials
and
Obama-era
Pentagon
officials
have
said
that
the
raid
was
also
approved
by
commanders
and
Obama's
defense
secretary.
Operational
details,
including
the
need
for
a
moonless
night,
pushed
the
mission
window
back
after
January
20.
As
US
Navy
SEALs
and
special
forces
from
the
UAE
approached
the
al
Qaeda
compound
in
Yemen,
they
were
detected.
An
intense
firefight
broke
out
that
killed
Chief
Petty
Officer
William
"Ryan"
Owens
and
wounded
three
additional
SEALs.
During
the
gun
battle,
which
featured
small
arms
fire,
hand
grenades
and
close
air
support
strikes
from
US
aircraft,
al
Qaeda
fighters
--
including
some
female
combatants
--
took
up
firing
positions
on
the
roof
of
a
nearby
building.
As
the
US
troops
came
under
fire,
they
called
in
an
airstrike
against
the
building,
which
likely
led
to
civilian
casualties,
military
officials
said.
The
group
is
thought
to
be
the
most
capable
of
al
Qaeda's
franchises.
Besides
the
"shoebomber,"
the
group
was
also
behind
the
2013
Boston
Marathon
attack,
a
2010
plot
to
put
bombs
on
cargo
planes
bound
for
two
Jewish
targets
in
the
US
and
the
deadly
2015
attack
on
the
Charlie
Hebdo
offices
in
Paris.
This
story
has
been
updated
throughout
to
explain
the
mix-up
over
the
video
released
by
CENTCOM.
Updates
will
continue
as
more
information
is
available.
