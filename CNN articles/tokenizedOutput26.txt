(CNN)North
Korean
leader
Kim
Jong
Un
has
fired
one
of
his
top
lieutenants,
according
to
South
Korea's
Unification
Ministry.CNN's
James
Griffiths
and
journalist
Taehoon
Lee
contributed
to
this
report.As
Minister
of
State
Security,
Kim
Won
Hong
oversaw
the
North
Korean
agency
responsible
for
running
the
country's
notorious
prison
camps,
rooting
out
spies
in
North
Korea
and
conducting
counterespionage
operations
abroad.
Unification
Ministry
spokesman
Jeong
Joon-hee
said
Kim
Won
Hong
was
punished
for
"human
rights
abuses
committed
during
interrogations
at
the
State
Security
Department"
among
other
things.
The
security
chief
was
one
of
seven
North
Korean
officials
sanctioned
by
the
US
Treasury
Department
on
January
11
for
human
rights
abuses.
He
was
removed
from
his
position
in
the
North
Korean
government
around
that
time,
the
South
Korean
official
said.
According
to
a
US
Treasury
statement,
Kim
Won
Hong
directed
and
managed
activities
including
"beatings,
forced
starvation,
sexual
assault,
forced
abortions,
and
infanticide"
that
took
place
in
the
system
of
prison
camps.
The
US
Treasury
order
froze
any
assets
of
Kim
Won
Hong
under
US
jurisdiction.
Although
Pyongyang
officially
denies
that
the
prison
camps
exist,
multiple
human
rights
groups
have
documented
their
ongoing
operation
via
survivor
testimony
and
satellite
imagery.
Last
November,
a
United
Nations
report
said
up
to
120,000
men,
women
and
children
are
imprisoned
in
the
camps,
known
as
"kwanliso"
in
Korean.
An
analysis
by
Amnesty
International
in
November
concluded
that
Pyongyang
"is
continuing
to
maintain,
and
even
invest,
in
these
repressive
facilities."
"These
camps
constitute
the
cornerstone
of
the
country's
large
infrastructure
dedicated
to
political
repression
and
social
control
that
enables
widespread
and
systematic
human
rights
abuses,"
Amnesty
said
in
a
statement.
