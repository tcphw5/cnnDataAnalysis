(CNN)House
Minority
Leader
Nancy
Pelosi
Thursday
called
the
appointment
of
Steve
Bannon,
the
President's
chief
strategist
to
the
National
Security
Council
"stunning,"
and
referred
to
him
twice
as
"white
supremacist."
"It's
a
stunning
thing,
that
a
white
supremacist
would
be
a
permanent
member
of
the
National
Security
Council,"
Pelosi
said
at
her
weekly
news
conference.
The
move
is
"making
America
less
safe,"
the
California
Democrat
added.
The
Democratic
National
Committee
doubled
down
on
that
criticism
Friday,
labeling
Bannon
Trump's
"white
supremacist
chief
strategist"
in
an
email
and
asking
recipients
to
demand
his
resignation.
Pelosi
has
been
critical
of
early
moves
by
the
Trump
administration,
but
she
also
Thursday
seemed
to
raise
question
about
the
President's
fitness
for
the
job.
She
brought
up
a
proposal
that
House
Oversight
Chairman
Jason
Chaffetz,
R-Utah,
was
reportedly
considering
that
would
require
an
independent
medical
assessment
of
the
condition
of
the
President,
including
mental
health.
"If
you're
going
to
have
your
hands
on
the
nuclear
codes,
you
probably
--
we
should
probably
know
what
mental
state
you're
in,"
Pelosi
said.
"I
can't
wait
until
he
introduces
that
legislation,
to
be
able
to
join
him
as
cosponsor
of
that,"
telling
reporters,
"I
think
it's
a
very
good
idea."
When
asked
about
her
early
overtures
to
Trump
--
attending
the
inauguration
and
expressing
willingness
to
work
with
the
new
President
--
Pelosi
cautioned
reporters:
"Please
don't
mistake
courtesy
for
approval
or
anything
else
positive."
Pelosi
repeated
her
vow
that
she
and
her
party
would
fight
the
Republican
effort
to
dismantle
the
health
care
law.
She
criticized
the
administration's
decision
to
stop
paying
for
advertisements
ahead
of
the
Obamacare
enrollment
deadline
and
predicted
about
the
Republican
effort
to
do
away
with
the
law.
"This
will
lead
to
suffering,
death,
disability,"
Pelosi
said.
