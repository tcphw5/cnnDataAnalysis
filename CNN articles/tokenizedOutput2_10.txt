(CNN)It
might
be
the
oldest
soft
tissue
sample
ever
found.
Researchers
discovered
ancient
collagen
and
protein
remains
preserved
in
the
ribs
of
a
dinosaur
that
walked
the
Earth
195
million
years
ago.
No,
this
doesn't
mean
"Jurassic
Park"
is
about
to
become
a
reality.
But
finding
such
well-preserved
organic
remains
from
one
of
the
oldest
dinosaurs,
a
Lufengosaurus,
is
unprecedented.
"This
finding
extends
the
record
of
preserved
organic
remains
more
than
100
million
years,"
the
researchers
said
in
their
study,
published
in
the
journal
Nature
Communications
on
Tuesday.
The
researchers
were
from
Taiwan,
China
and
Canada.
Previously
found
collagen
fragments
dated
back
75
million
or
80
million
years
ago.
The
location
of
the
newly
discovered
collagen
was
also
surprising.
"Usually,
people
have
looked
and
found
collagen
in
the
big,
massive
limb
bones,
not
in
the
more
delicate
ribs,"
said
Robert
Reisz,
one
of
the
authors
of
the
study
and
a
paleontologist
at
University
of
Toronto
Mississauga.
Collagen
is
one
of
the
main
protein
components
in
connective
tissues
and
skin.
In
this
case,
the
researchers
believe
that
the
collagen
and
protein
they
found
in
the
tiny
vascular
canals
of
the
rib
represent
the
remains
of
blood
vessels.
When
the
dinosaur
was
alive,
this
is
where
blood
vessels,
blood
and
nerves
would
have
been
housed.
Hematite
samples,
represented
by
dark
red
dots,
were
also
found
in
the
vascular
canals.
Hematite
is
a
mineral
that
can
be
derived
from
iron-rich
hemoglobin,
the
protein
molecule
in
red
blood
cells
that
transports
oxygen
from
the
lungs
to
tissues.
The
hematite
most
likely
came
from
hemoglobin
and
other
iron-rich
proteins
in
the
dinosaur's
blood,
acting
like
a
preservative
for
the
collagen,
the
researchers
said.
Studying
these
samples
can
give
them
a
better
idea
of
the
early
stages
of
dinosaur
evolution.
The
researchers
also
focused
on
preservation
and
used
noninvasive
imaging
techniques
such
as
spectroscopy
and
microspectroscopy
rather
than
removing
the
samples
and
dissolving
away
parts
of
the
fossil,
like
in
similar,
previous
studies.
This
also
decreased
the
likelihood
of
the
sample
becoming
contaminated
with
modern
bacteria.
Lufengosaurus
lived
190
million
to
200
million
years
ago,
making
it
one
of
the
oldest
dinosaurs
from
the
early
Jurassic
period.
Characterized
by
a
long
neck
and
body
that
stretched
about
26
feet,
it
probably
spent
part
of
its
time
walking
on
two
legs.
Even
though
it
had
sharp
teeth
and
claws,
Lufengosaurus
was
most
likely
a
herbivore.
It
was
a
type
of
sauropodomorpha,
a
class
of
long-necked
"lizard-footed"
dinosaurs
that
fed
on
plants.
Their
fossils,
and
even
nests
containing
embryos,
are
most
commonly
found
in
Lufeng,
for
which
they
were
named,
in
China's
Yunnan
Province.
Some
of
the
same
researchers
from
this
study
discovered
the
"bonebed"
of
nests
full
of
embryos,
also
including
preserved
organic
remains,
in
2013.
"Previously,
we
had
some
evidence
of
organic
remains
in
the
embryos,
but
did
not
really
have
any
detailed
information
about
those
organics,"
Reisz
said.
The
researchers
hope
that
their
discovery
will
enable
to
them
to
find
more
preserved
ancient
proteins
and
study
them
in
a
way
that
promotes
preservation.
