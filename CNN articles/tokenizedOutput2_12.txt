(CNN)Found
--
one
lost
continent,
hiding
underneath
a
tropical
holiday
destination.
It
might
sound
implausible,
but
deep
at
the
bottom
of
the
Indian
Ocean,
a
research
team,
led
by
South
Africa's
University
of
the
Witwatersrand,
has
found
pieces
of
an
ancient
continent.
The
lava-covered
piece
of
continent,
dubbed
'Mauritia,'
was
found
under
the
popular
island
of
Mauritius.
According
to
the
report
published
this
week
in
the
journal
Nature
Communications,
the
piece
of
crust
is
left
over
from
the
breakup
of
Gondwanaland,
a
super-continent
that
existed
more
than
200
million
years
ago.
Containing
rocks
up
to
3.6
billion
years
old,
Gondawanaland
split
into
what
now
are
Africa,
South
America,
Antarctica,
India
and
Australia.
Professor
Lewis
Ashwal,
lead
author
of
the
paper,
says
there
are
a
number
of
pieces
of
"undiscovered
continent"
of
various
sizes
spread
over
the
Indian
Ocean,
left
over
by
the
breakup.
"This
breakup
did
not
involve
a
simple
splitting
of
the
ancient
super-continent
of
Gondwana,"
says
Ashwal,
but
"a
complex
splintering
took
place
with
fragments
of
continental
crust
of
variable
sizes
left
adrift
within
the
evolving
Indian
Ocean
basin."
The
team
made
the
discovery
by
analyzing
a
mineral
--
zircon
--
found
in
rocks
spewed
up
by
lava
during
volcanic
eruptions.
They
said
that
remnants
of
the
mineral
were
way
too
old
to
belong
to
Mauritius.
"Mauritius
is
an
island,
and
there
is
no
rock
older
than
9
million
years
old
on
the
island,"
says
Ashwal.
But
by
studying
rocks
on
the
island,
they
found
zircons
that
were
3
billion
years
old.
The
researchers
say
these
findings
corroborate
a
study
done
in
2013
that
found
traces
of
ancient
zircons
in
beach
sand.
But
critics
said
the
mineral
could
have
been
blown
in
by
the
wind,
or
carried
in
by
the
scientists.
Ashwal
says
the
fact
the
team
found
ancient
zircons
in
rock
"refutes
any
suggestion
of
wind-blown,
wave-transported
or
pumice-rafted
zircons."
The
researchers
say
their
results
demonstrate,
in
no
uncertain
terms,
"the
existence
of
ancient
continental
crust
beneath
Mauritius."

you

almost
nothing
about
That
continent
might
be
lost
forever,
but
it's
still
leaving
traces
to
remind
us
of
its
existence.
"The
fact
that
we
have
found
zircons
of
this
age
proves
that
there
are
much
older
crustal
materials
under
Mauritius
that
could
only
have
originated
from
a
continent,"
said
Ashwal.
