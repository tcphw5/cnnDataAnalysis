(CNN)An
emaciated
lion
lying
curled
up
on
a
rubble-strewn
floor;
a
bear
peering
through
a
window,
looking
scared.
These
animals,
pictured
in
images
posted
on
social
media
by
activist
blogger
Mosul
Eye
this
week,
are
the
only
two
that
survived
after
a
Mosul
zoo
was
destroyed
in
the
battle
to
retake
the
city
from
ISIS.
Many
people
were
killed
in
the
fighting,
nearly
2,000
Iraqi
troops
in
the
month
of
November
alone.
As
the
images
posted
by
Mosul
Eye
show,
zoo
animals
were
also
casualties
in
the
conflict.
Before
ISIS
invaded
the
city
in
2014,
the
animals
were
housed
in
the
zoo
in
a
public
park
along
the
banks
of
the
Tigris
River,
a
strategic
location
in
the
battle
for
the
city.
The
park
was
taken
over
by
ISIS
and
used
as
a
military
base,
said
the
blogger,
who
documented
life
in
the
city
under
ISIS.
Communicating
with
CNN
via
Twitter,
the
blogger
asked
to
remain
anonymous
for
safety
reasons.
CNN
is
unable
to
verify
the
Mosul
Eye
blog
and
its
posts
on
Twitter
and
Facebook
independently,
but
Iraqi
journalists
and
scholars
vouch
for
its
veracity.
After
eastern
Mosul
was
liberated
in
January,
residents
found
the
animals
roaming
free
in
a
smaller
park
in
Mosul's
Al-Murur
neighborhood,
the
blogger
said,
estimating
that
the
lion
and
bear
survived
on
their
own
for
over
four
months.
Of
all
the
zoo's
animals,
only
the
bear
and
the
lion
pictured
in
Mosul
Eye's
photos
remain.
A
lioness
that
made
it
through
the
battle
recently
died,
and
many
of
the
zoo's
monkeys,
rabbits
and
other
animals
died
during
ISIS'
occupation,
according
to
Mosul
Eye.
Now
life
in
eastern
Mosul,
where
the
zoo
was
located,
is
slowly
returning
to
normal.
Youth
volunteer
teams
are
engaged
in
efforts
to
make
their
city
beautiful
again,
according
to
Mosul
Eye.
And
Mosul
Eye's
plea
for
help
for
the
animals
did
not
go
unanswered.
A
Kurdish
veterinarian
sent
food
for
them,
the
blogger
said.
Residents
are
also
working
to
clean
up
the
park
where
the
bear
and
lion
are
living.
There
is
a
lot
more
work
to
be
done,
but
Mosul
Eye
hopes
that
efforts
to
take
care
of
the
animals
will
bring
a
measure
of
humanity
back
to
his
city.
"When
you
learn
to
care
for
the
animals
and
be
kind
to
them,
then
you
will
know
the
value
of
human
life.
In
this
life,
everything
is
connected.
There's
no
part
that
is
worthless."
