(CNN)The
Senate
voted
early
Friday
to
advance
President
Donald
Trump's
education
secretary
nominee
Betsy
DeVos
to
a
final
confirmation
vote,
which
is
expected
Monday.CNN's
Phil
Mattingly
contributed
to
this
report.
The
vote
was
52
to
48
along
party
lines.
Senators
convened
at
the
unusual,
early
hour
--
6:30
a.m.
ET
--
because
of
Democratic
stalling
tactics
that
reflect
their
unhappiness
with
Trump's
cabinet
picks
and
the
overall
confirmation
process.
DeVos
has
come
under
fire
from
Democrats
and
two
key
Republicans
for
her
positions
on
public
and
charter
schools,
as
well
as
statements
made
during
her
confirmation
hearing
last
month.
Despite
losing
support
from
Republican
Sens.
Susan
Collins
of
Maine
and
Lisa
Murkowski
of
Alaska,
she
is
expected
to
be
confirmed
Monday
with
the
help
of
Vice
President
Mike
Pence,
who
will
be
in
the
chamber
to
break
an
expected
50-50
tie.
Collins
and
Murkowski,
who
both
have
said
they
intend
to
vote
against
DeVos'
final
conformation,
voted
to
end
the
debate
and
advance
her
confirmation,
as
expected.
In
an
impassioned
show
of
opposition,
Senate
Minority
Leader
Chuck
Schumer
implored
other
senators
to
"look
into
their
conscience"
over
the
weekend
and
reconsider
their
support
for
DeVos,
saying
she
is
"one
of
the
worst
nominees
that
has
ever
been"
brought
before
the
Senate.
"Sometimes
loyalty
to
a
new
president
demands
a
bit
too
much,"
he
said.
"With
this
nominee
it
does."
Following
the
vote,
Sen.
Patty
Murray,
a
Democrat
from
Washington
State
and
the
ranking
member
on
the
education
committee
that
held
a
hearing
on
DeVos'
nomination,
took
to
the
Senate
floor
to
deliver
a
25-minute
speech
blasting
the
nominee,
a
Michigan
billionaire,
not
only
on
her
positions
but
over
questions
about
her
finances
and
conflicts
of
interest.
Republican
Sen.
Lamar
Alexander,
the
chairman
of
the
education
committee,
also
appeared
on
the
floor
to
defend
DeVos,
citing
her
work
in
the
conservative
education
reform
movement
over
the
years.
"I'm
pleased
to
support
her,"
he
said,
adding
that
he
looks
forward
to
the
final
vote
on
her
nomination
early
next
week.
In
an
interview
with
CNN
after
the
vote,
Sen.
John
Cornyn
of
Texas
--
the
No.
2
Republican
in
the
Senate
--
said
the
Democrats'
concerns
weren't
"particularly
fair"
and
argued
that
their
ties
to
teachers
unions
are
influencing
them
politically.
"If
people
think
our
public
education
system
is
perfect,
then
I
guess
they
don't
think
we
need
to
have
any
changes
or
any
choices
for
students
and
their
families,"
he
said.
"I
certainly
think
we
do."
