Treasury
allowing
for
some
transactions
with
Russian
intelligence
agency

it
unfolds.
(CNN)The
Treasury
Department
said
Thursday
it
will
allow
for
some
companies
to
do
limited
business
with
Russia's
Federal
Security
Service,
known
as
the
FSB.
The
move
is
a
minor
easing
of
a
sanction
put
in
place
at
the
end
of
the
Obama
administration
that
limits
business
to
$5,000
for
any
calendar
year.
A
top
State
Department
official
said
the
move
was
made
as
a
technical
fix
to
the
sanctions
that
were
put
in
place
to
avoid
"unintended
consequences"
of
US
government
business
with
Russia.
President
Donald
Trump
denied
Thursday
he'd
eased
sanctions
on
Russia.
"I
haven't
eased
anything,"
Trump
said
during
a
meeting
with
Harley-Davidson
executives
at
the
White
House.
White
House
press
secretary
Sean
Spicer
said
the
same
during
his
daily
press
briefing.
"From
what
I
understand
it's
a
fairly
common
practice
for
the
Treasury
Department,
after
sanctions
are
in
place,
to
go
back
and
look
at
whether
or
not
there
needs
to
be
specific
carve-outs
for
different
industries
or
products
or
services,"
he
said.
He
said
the
move
didn't
reflect
a
shift
in
policy,
but
rather
a
"regular
course
of
action."
The
fix
was
in
the
works
soon
after
the
sanctions
were
put
in
place
because
FSB
is
also
involved
in
customs
and
border
checks
on
trade.
The
sanctions
had
the
unintended
consequence
of
preventing
US
businesses
from
being
able
to
pay
some
necessary
trade-related
costs
to
the
Russian
government.
US
intelligence
agencies
accused
the
FSB
of
being
involved
in
the
election-related
hacking
last
year.
The
Treasury
Department
did
not
immediately
respond
to
a
CNN
request
for
comment.
