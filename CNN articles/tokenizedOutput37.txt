(CNN)Beyoncé
sure
knows
how
to
get
our
attention.
Join
us
on
Twitter
and
FacebookShe's
done
it
again
and
again
with
her
culture-stopping
music,
videos
and
and
performances.
All
The
Single
Ladies,
which
launched
countless
YouTube
videos
of
toddlers
dancing
and
one
infamous
Kanye
West
tirade.
Or,
how
about
when
she
asked
"Who
run
the
world?"
(The
answer:
girls
-
a
theme
she
would
return
to
again
and
again).
Striding
out
at
the
2014
VMAs
flanked
by
the
giant
word
"FEMINIST."
Other
significant
moments:
Her
2013
self-titled
visual
album,
stealth-dropped
in
late
December
and
instantly
required
listening
and
viewing.
Also,
the
revelation
that
was
"Formation."
And
her
2016
Superbowl
performance
(very
popular
with
conservatives).
Lemonade,
the
album
that
launched
a
thousand
thinkpieces
about
her
politics
and
identity
(sample
headline:
"Beyonce's
'Lemonade'
Is
an
Anthem
for
the
Retribution
of
Black
Women.")
Then,
earlier
this
week,
she
added
her
announcement
via
Instagram
-
bedecked
in
flowers,
a
veil
and
her
glorious
fecundity
-
that
she
is
pregnant
with
twins.
Predictably,
the
Internet
went
bananas.
Her
post
zoomed
to
most-liked-ever
status
inside
a
day.
Twitter
was
beside
itself
with
bee
emojis
and
"YASSS
QUEEEN"
updates.
The
joy
was
palpable.
Joy
--
and
relief.
Because,
man
did
we
ever
need
some
good
news.
It
has
been
a
rough
few
weeks
in
the
news
cycle
(for
people
who
care
about
democracy
and
due
process
and
the
welfare
of
their
fellow
humans).
A
breathless
pace
of
executive
orders
attacking
the
environment,
women,
refugees,
lawful
visa-holders
and
US
parks
employees
has
led
to
record-breaking
protests,
an
unrelenting
call-your-Senator
schedule
and
Jon
Stewart
channelling
just
how
exhausted
we
all
are.
So
we
really,
really
needed
something
to
feel
good
about.
Beyoncé
delivered
that
to
us
with
her
announcement,
which
was
styled
with
the
kind
of
bravado,
exuberance
and
confidence
that
even
a
dude
who
lives
in
a
solid-gold
tower
could
never
get
away
with.
And
she
doubled
down
on
it
with
a
collection
of
photographs
so
resplendently
gorgeous
and
near-otherworldly
(I
mean,
just
look
at
this
one
and
this
one,
and
this
one)
that
it
actually
succeeded
in
not
just
distracting
us
from
the
dark
craziness
swirling
around
the
country,
but
transporting
us
completely,
if
momentarily,
into
another
(happier)
world.
This
is
classic
Beyoncé.
Beyoncé,
who
flagrantly
loves
her
body
and
demands
that
you
respect
it,
now
reminds
us
that
it's
a
body
that
can
march
like
a
boss
in
heels
but
also
swell
with
life
and
hope,
sexy
and
powerful
in
all
its
forms.
(And
she
does
it
while
sitting
on
a
throne
of
flowers,
lest
you
forget
she
is
the
Queen.)
It
is
possible,
of
course,
for
Beyoncé's
pregnancy
to
exist
without
reference
to
Donald
Trump.
He
doesn't
get
to
be
part
of
every
story,
even
as
he
barges
into
our
every
waking
moment
with
new
acts
of
cruelty
or
rule-flouting
or
self-aggrandizement
or
jaw-dropping
ignorance.
Even
so,
it's
hard
not
to
see
a
juxtaposition
here.
Trump's
administration
has
focused
on
restricting,
undoing,
and
upending.
But
Beyoncé
is
creating.
That
was
the
theme
of
her
photo
collection.
Called
"I
Have
Three
Hearts,"
it
was
paired
with
a
poem
of
the
same
name
by
the
Somalian
poet
Warsan
Shire,
who
also
wrote
the
poetry
in
Lemonade
--
and
who,
I
guess,
would
not
be
allowed
to
enter
the
United
States.
It
reads:
"There's
life
growing
inside
of
me
and
I'm
beside
myself
with
dreams."
In
a
real
and
visceral
way,
Beyoncé
has
reminded
us
that
even
in
times
that
feel
broken,
we
are
vessels
of
power
and
glory
and
hope.
Is
what
I
am
saying
over
the
top
here?
Maybe,
but
I
found
those
images
coupled
with
that
poem
to
be
profoundly
moving
as
a
mother
and
a
feminist
and,
well,
a
human.
I
will
leave
the
smart
thinkpieces
about
the
poem
to
other
writers,
(I'm
looking
at
you,
Melissa
Harris-Perry)
but
one
line
in
particular
stands
out
to
me:
"Flowers
grow
wherever."
Flowers
grow
wherever.
When
the
books
are
written
about
this
period
in
time,
I
believe
that
will
be
an
enduring
theme
--
the
hope
that
sprang
up
out
of
the
chaos,
and
the
real
and
visceral
good
that
it
created.
Beyoncé
just
named
it.
Creators
gonna
create.
