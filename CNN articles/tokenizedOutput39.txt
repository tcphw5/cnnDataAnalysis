(CNN)President
Donald
Trump's
administration
warned
Thursday
that
new
Israeli
settlement
activity
could
potentially
hamper
the
peace
process,
a
new
stance
for
a
White
House
that's
remained
adamant
in
its
support
for
Prime
Minister
Benjamin
Netanyahu.CNN's
Laura
Koran
and
Elise
Labott
contributed
to
this
report.Despite
the
shift,
the
White
House
said
it
hadn't
taken
an
official
position
on
Israeli
settlements,
saying
it
would
wait
until
Trump
meets
with
Netanyahu
later
this
month
to
formally
develop
a
position.
"While
we
don't
believe
the
existence
of
settlements
is
an
impediment
to
peace,
the
construction
of
new
settlements
or
the
expansion
of
existing
settlements
beyond
their
current
borders
may
not
be
helpful
in
achieving
that
goal,"
White
House
press
secretary
Sean
Spicer
said
in
a
statement.
"The
Trump
administration
has
not
taken
an
official
position
on
settlement
activity
and
looks
forward
to
continuing
discussions,
including
with
Prime
Minister
Netanyahu
when
he
visits
with
President
Trump
later
this
month,"
Spicer
said.
Secretary
of
State
Rex
Tillerson
spoke
with
Netanyahu
Thursday,
the
State
Department
said.
Tillerson
"stressed
America's
steadfast
commitment
to
its
key
allies
and
partners
as
it
works
to
protect
the
interests
and
safety
of
the
American
people,"
a
State
Department
statement
said,
adding
that
Tillerson
also
spoke
with
his
German,
Mexican
and
Canadian
counterparts.
It
was
not
immediately
clear
if
Tillerson
spoke
with
Netanyahu
before
or
after
the
White
House's
statement
on
settlements,
though
the
White
House
statement
was
issued
during
the
middle
of
the
night
in
Israel.
Netanyahu
is
due
at
the
White
House
for
talks
on
February
15.
Israel
announced
a
large
new
expansion
of
projects
shortly
after
Trump
was
sworn
in.
In
response
to
a
request
for
comment
from
CNN
on
the
White
House
statement,
the
Israeli
Prime
Minister's
Office
issued
its
own
statement:
"Prime
Minister
Netanyahu
looks
forward
to
his
meeting
with
President
Trump
on
February
15th
in
which
they
will
speak
about
a
wide
range
of
issues,
including
(settlements)."
Trump
lambasted
the
previous
administration
for
allowing
a
United
Nations
Security
Council
resolution
to
pass
that
condemned
Israel's
settlements.
The
move
drove
a
wedge
between
the
incoming
and
outgoing
administrations
during
the
transition
period
after
Trump
spoke
out
vocally
against
the
resolution.
Shortly
after
taking
office,
Trump
spoke
with
Netanyahu
in
a
conversation
that
both
sides
described
as
warm.
Israel
since
then
has
announced
new
plans
to
establish
a
settlement
in
the
West
Bank,
replacing
the
illegal
Amona
construction
that
was
demolished
this
week.
The
new
settlement
would
be
the
first
in
almost
20
years
in
the
West
Bank,
and
the
creation
of
thousands
of
homes
in
the
area
is
seen
as
an
attempt
by
Netanyahu
to
appease
his
right-wing
base
in
the
wake
of
the
evacuation
of
the
Amona
outpost.
President
Barack
Obama
was
sharply
critical
of
settlement
activity,
a
stance
that
caused
friction
between
himself
and
Netanyahu.
Trump,
meanwhile,
has
signaled
a
more
tolerant
view,
naming
a
US
ambassador
to
Israel,
David
Friedman,
who
supports
an
expansion
of
settlements.
