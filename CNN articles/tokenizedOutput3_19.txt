R
&
B
star
Faith
Evans
announced
on
Friday
that
"The
King
&
I"
will
be
released
on
May
19,
two
days
before
what
would
have
been
the
rapper's
45th
birthday.
The
Notorious
B.I.G.
--
also
known
as
Biggie
Smalls
and
born
Christopher
Wallace
--
was
gunned
down
in
Los
Angeles
on
March
9,
1997.
Evans
and
Wallace
were
still
legally
married
but
estranged
at
the
time
of
his
death.
The
couple
met
on
a
photo
shoot
in
1994
and
married
nine
days
later.
Both
were
artists
on
the
Bad
Boy
record
label.
Their
romance
was
the
hip
hop
version
of
Elizabeth
Taylor
and
Richard
Burton,
complete
with
public
accusations
of
infidelity
and
blow
out
fights.
But
there
was
also
the
art.
They
worked
together
on
one
of
the
rapper's
biggest
hits,
the
remix
of
his
single
"One
More
Chance."
According
to
Evan's
site,
the
album
will
contain
25
tracks
featuring
newly
recorded
vocals
by
Evans
combined
with
the
rapper's
vocals.
The
project
will
include
both
well-known
songs
and
"a
selection
of
rare
and
unheard
rhymes
from
the
B.I.G.
vault.
"
Guest
artists
will
include
Busta
Rhymes,
Jadakiss,
Lil'
Cease,
Lil'
Kim,
Sheek
Louch,
Styles
P,
and
Snoop
Dogg.
"I
remember
telling
Ms.
Wallace
[the
rapper's
mother]
years
ago
that
one
day
it
would
be
really
dope
if
I
could
do
something
similar
to
Natalie
and
Nat
King
Cole's
Unforgettable,"
Evans
said
in
a
statement.
"Knowing
the
love
that
B.I.G.
had
for
Tyanna
[his
daughter]
&
Ceejay
[his
son
by
Evans],
I
feel
it's
my
duty
to
uphold
and
extend
his
legacy,
especially
his
musical
contributions."
"This
project
is
my
creative
reflection
of
the
love
we
had
and
the
bond
we
will
always
have,"
she
added.
"I'm
elated
to
share
this
musical
journey
with
our
fans!"
Biggie's
mother,
Voletta
Wallace,
will
also
provide
narration
on
some
of
the
album's
interludes.
