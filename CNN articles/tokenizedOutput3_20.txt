(CNN)The
Republican-led
House
voted
Thursday
to
repeal
an
Obama-era
regulation
that
required
the
Social
Security
Administration
to
disclose
to
the
national
gun
background
check
system
information
about
people
with
mental
illness.
CLARIFICATION:
The
story
and
headline
have
been
updated
to
more
fully
reflect
the
impact
of
the
rule.The
regulation
instituted
in
the
final
days
of
the
Obama
administration
required
the
SSA
to
share
information
about
those
who
are
considered
incapable
of
managing
their
own
disability
benefits
due
mental
illness.
The
rule
sought
to
limit
the
ability
of
those
with
mental
illness
to
purchase
guns
but
drew
criticism
for
casting
too
wide
a
net
and
not
providing
the
opportunity
for
due
process.
Opponents
of
the
rule,
including
the
National
Rifle
Association
and
the
American
Civil
Liberties
Union,
also
said
the
broad
range
of
reasons
that
could
be
used
to
designate
someone
for
the
SSA
database
include
conditions
that
should
not
stop
a
gun
purchase.
The
vote
was
235-180.
"The
Social
Security
Administration
not
only
overstepped
its
mission
with
this
regulation,
it
discriminated
against
certain
Americans
with
disabilities
who
receive
Social
Security
benefits.
The
agency
should
be
focused
on
serving
all
of
its
beneficiaries,
not
picking
and
choosing
whose
Second
Amendment
rights
to
deny,"
said
Rep.
Kevin
Brady,
R-Texas,
who
chairs
the
Ways
and
Means
Committee.
Democrats
complained
that
repealing
the
rule,
which
was
adopted
in
the
waning
days
of
the
Obama
administration,
would
lead
to
more
gun
violence.
"The
American
people
and
the
families
that
are
being
hurt
day
after
day
by
gun
violence
--
they
deserve
some
due
process
too,"
said
Rep.
Lloyd
Doggett,
D-Texas.
Republicans
are
using
the
Congressional
Review
Act
to
roll
back
all
manner
of
regulations
put
in
place
by
Obama
before
he
left
office.
The
Senate
is
expected
to
pass
the
National
Rifle
Association-backed
measure
soon
and
President
Donald
Trump
is
expected
to
sign
it.
