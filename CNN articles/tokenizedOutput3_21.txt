(CNN)President
Donald
Trump
will
begin
work
Friday
dismantling
the
financial
regulations
enacted
after
the
2008
economic
crisis,
hours
after
the
first
major
economic
report
of
his
administration
is
released.Trump's
executive
moves
won't
have
an
immediate
effect
on
Wall
Street
oversight.
But
they're
likely
to
draw
sharp
criticism
from
Democrats
and
reform
proponents
who
say
the
regulations
that
the
President
is
looking
to
scrap
could
prevent
another
meltdown.
In
two
executive
actions,
Trump
plans
to
direct
his
administration
to
evaluate
regulatory
action
taken
by
his
predecessor,
Barack
Obama,
with
an
eye
toward
eliminating
what
his
advisers
say
are
burdensome
rules
on
financial
services
firms
and
consumers.
He'll
also
force
the
delay
of
an
Obama-era
rule
that
required
retirement
advisers
to
act
in
their
clients'
best
interests.
The
midday
moves
will
come
after
the
Labor
Department
releases
jobs
figures
from
January.
Hiring
rebounded
sharply
under
Obama
following
the
financial
crisis,
but
Trump
has
previously
questioned
the
accuracy
of
the
monthly
reports
from
the
Bureau
of
Labor
Statistics.
He'll
sign
his
actions
following
a
planned
meeting
with
US
chief
executives,
including
bosses
at
JPMorgan
Chase,
Blackstone,
IBM,
Tesla
and
General
Motors.
The
CEO
of
Uber
said
Thursday
he
wouldn't
participate
in
the
meeting
since
he
opposes
Trump's
executive
order
on
refugees
and
immigration.
In
his
first
order,
Trump
will
issue
a
broad
directive
meant
to
garner
input
from
the
heads
of
federal
regulatory
agencies
on
areas
for
reform.
The
move
won't
make
any
immediate
changes
to
the
agencies
or
their
policies;
rather,
it
will
solicit
recommendations
for
changes
to
the
Dodd-Frank
Wall
Street
reform
law
that
was
enacted
in
2010.
"Everything
is
going
to
be
looked
at,"
said
a
senior
administration
official,
speaking
anonymously
to
preview
the
order
before
it
was
signed.
The
official
conceded
a
complete
gutting
of
the
law
would
require
Congress
to
act
--
"This
is
not
an
attempt
to
undo
Dodd-Frank"
--
but
identified
areas
where
Trump
could
make
unilateral
changes,
like
placing
his
own
directors
at
key
regulatory
bodies.
The
official
demurred
if
that
meant
Trump
planned
to
fire
the
current
head
of
the
Consumer
Financial
Protection
Bureau,
a
brainchild
of
Sen.
Elizabeth
Warren
that's
expected
to
be
on
Trump's
chopping
block.
Trump
on
Monday
called
Dodd-Frank
as
"disaster"
and
vowed
to
"do
a
big
number
on
it."
A
second
action
Friday
will
direct
the
Department
of
Labor
to
cease
implementation
of
an
Obama
administration
rule
on
retirement
investment
advisers,
which
is
supposed
to
take
effect
in
April.
That
measure,
called
the
"Fiduciary
Rule,"
required
retirement
advisers
to
always
act
in
their
clients'
best
interests.
But
the
Trump
administration
official
said
the
rule
was
a
"complete
mess"
with
a
litany
of
unintended
consequences.
The
official
said
the
rule
was
"protecting
(consumers)
from
something
they
don't
need
protection
from,"
arguing
it
limited
options
and
proved
expensive
for
asset
management
firms
to
implement.
The
Labor
Department
will
have
90
days
to
reevaluate
the
rule
and
report
back.
They'll
have
the
final
say
on
whether
the
rule
is
enacted.
Both
moves
are
expected
to
draw
the
ire
of
consumer
protection
activists,
who
argue
even
Dodd-Frank
didn't
go
far
enough
in
reining
in
Wall
Street
following
the
financial
meltdown
in
2008.
