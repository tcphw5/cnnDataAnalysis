(CNN)So
what's
so
special
about
Subway,
you
might
ask?
After
all,
a
sandwich
is
a
sandwich
--
right?

yes
and
no.Get

Drayer
is
a
nutritionist,
author
and
health
journalist.Yes,
you
can
choose
from
pre-designed
sandwiches
at
the
chain,
including
the
typical
turkey,
ham
and
roast
beef
varieties.
But
what
we
really
like
about
the
sub
stop
is
that
any
menu
item
can
be
customized
to
meet
your
diet
preferences:
breads,
meats
and
cheeses,
veggies
and
dressings.
You
can
think
of
it
as
one
big
sandwich
buffet
--
that
is,
without
having
to
worry
about
portion
control.
Here's
more
food
for
thought:
If
you
think
of
Subway
solely
as
a
sandwich
chain,
you
might
be
surprised
to
learn
that
from
the
time
the
first
store
opened
in
1965,
salads
have
been
on
the
menu.
We're
not
talking
about
new
culinary
creations
but
simple
adaptations.
For
example,
a
sub
can
quickly
morph
into
a
salad
if
you
ask
for
the
sandwich
to
be
prepared
as
a
salad.
The
ingredients
are
pretty
much
the
same
(except
for
the
bread),
just
in
different
proportions
(i.e.
more
veggies,
including
spinach,
and
olives).
Chopped
salads
were
introduced
in
2012.
The
same
rule
applies
to
breakfast:.
If
you
want
the
egg
whites
and
cheese
from
an
egg
and
cheese
breakfast
sandwich
to
sit
on
top
of
a
bed
of
leafy
greens,
all
you
have
to
do
is
ask
your
sandwich
artist.
Also
worth
mentioning:
More
than
80%
of
Subway
restaurants
offer
soup,
though
varieties
can
differ
according
to
location.
Most
of
our
sandwich
picks
come
from
Subway's
Fresh
Fit
menu,
which
includes
sandwiches
that
are
low
in
saturated
fat,
are
sensible
in
calories
and
have
less
sodium
than
some
of
the
other
sandwiches.
When
it
comes
to
breads,
the
chain's
nine-grain
wheat
bread
and
multigrain
flatbread
are
richest
in
whole
grains
and
fiber.
The
standard
build
for
all
sandwiches
and
salads
contains
five
fresh
veggies
--
lettuce,
tomato,
cucumbers,
peppers
and
onions
--
but
you
are
welcome
to
add
or
subtract
toppings
as
you
wish.
Sandwich
condiments
such
as
light
mayonnaise
and
mustard
add
flavor
but
will
contribute
small
amounts
of
sodium.
Though
most
vegetables
will
not
make
a
dent
in
your
daily
sodium
budget,
pickles
do
contribute
115
milligrams.
Cheese
contributes
sodium,
too:
American
cheese
has
the
most,
at
200
milligrams
per
serving.
Salad
dressings
and
sauces
deliver
more
sodium
than
most
condiments,
but
the
oil
and
vinegar
dressing
is
sodium-free.
To
limit
added
sugars,
pair
your
salad
or
sub
with
water
or
unsweetened
tea
instead
of
sugar-sweetened
beverages.
Below
are,
by
my
estimation,
the
best
Subway
options
if
you're
focused
on
healthy
choices
within
the
limits
of
the
menu.
We
break
it
down
by
our
picks
for
kids,
athletes,
drivers,
vegetarians
and
vegans,
as
well
as
low-calorie,
low-sugar,
low-salt,
gluten-free
and
low-carb
options.
(Note:
All
sandwiches
are
6
inches
long,
unless
otherwise
noted.)
For
kids
Our
picks:
Roast
beef
mini
sandwich
on
nine-grain
wheat
bread;
or
Veggie
Delite
mini
sandwich
on
nine-grain
wheat
bread
with
shredded
Monterey
cheddar;
and
apple
slices
and
low-fat
milk
At
Subway,
kids
can
enjoy
the
same
sandwiches
as
grownups,
but
in
smaller
sizes.
A
"Fresh
Fit
for
Kids
Meal"
includes
a
Fresh
Fit
mini
sub,
which
is
a
4-inch
sandwich
that
is
low
in
saturated
fat
and
calories.
Our
top
pick
is
the
roast
beef
mini,
as
it's
the
most
protein-rich
of
the
four
kids'
sandwich
options,
and
it's
the
lowest-sodium
meat
option.
For
a
vegetarian
kids
option,
choose
the
Veggie
Delite
sandwich
with
shredded
Monterey
cheddar,
which
has
less
than
half
the
sodium
of
processed
American
cheese.
The
kids
meal
comes
with
apple
slices
and
a
choice
of
low-fat,
calcium-rich
milk
or
fruit
punch;
we
recommend
the
milk
for
kids'
growing
bones.
For
vegetarians
Our
picks:
Veggie
Delite
sandwich
on
multigrain
flatbread
with
shredded
Monterey
cheddar
(toasted);
or
salad
with
egg
whites,
cheese,
avocado
and
oil
and
vinegar
dressing
Whether
you're
vegetarian
or
simply
in
the
mood
for
a
meatless
meal,
Subway
will
satisfy
your
needs.
The
chain
offers
a
Veggie
Delite
sub,
a
combination
of
lettuce,
tomatoes,
green
peppers,
cucumbers
and
onions
on
bread.
If
that
doesn't
sound
exciting,
give
it
a
tasty
upgrade
by
ordering
it
with
multigrain
flatbread,
which
is
rich
in
fiber
and
whole
grains,
and
ask
for
it
to
be
toasted
with
shredded
Monterey
cheddar.
You
can
also
get
a
lighter,
vegetarian
version
of
a
Cobb
salad
by
ordering
an
egg
white
and
cheese
sandwich
as
a
chopped
salad.
Add
guacamole
if
it's
available
to
boost
heart-healthy
fats,
and
top
with
oil
and
vinegar
dressing.
For
vegans
Our
picks:
Veggie
Delite
sandwich
on
Italian
bread
with
vinaigrette;
or
black
bean
soup
Vegans
who
visit
Subway
can
enjoy
the
Veggie
Delite
sandwich
with
vinaigrette
dressing
for
a
filling,
fiber-rich
meal.
For
vegans
who
avoid
honey,
we
recommend
the
Veggie
Delite
sandwich
on
Italian
bread;
however,
for
those
who
include
honey
as
part
of
a
vegan
diet,
we
recommend
the
nine-grain
wheat
bread,
which
is
richer
in
whole
grains.
(Note:
Sourdough
and
roasted
garlic
are
also
vegan
breads,
though
not
all
chains
carry
them.)
Vegans
can
choose
from
toppings
including
mustard,
oil,
vinegar,
pickles,
jalapenos
and
sweet
onion
sauce.
Another
satisfying
vegan
option
offered
at
some
locations
is
the
low-fat
black
bean
soup,
with
12
grams
of
protein
and
15
grams
of
fiber.
You
can
even
combine
the
soup
with
the
sandwich,
depending
on
your
appetite.
Also
worth
noting:
If
you
are
near
one
of
the
400
or
so
Subway
locations
that
offer
it,
you
can
order
a
vegan
vegetable
patty
sub,
though
its
sodium
count
is
on
the
higher
side,
at
about
1,000
milligrams.
For
calorie
counters
Our
picks:
Turkey
breast
salad;
or
Black
Forest
ham
salad
with
honey
mustard
dressing;
or
turkey
breast
sandwich
on
nine-grain
wheat
bread
with
honey
mustard
sauce;
and
apple
slices
We
love
that
Subway
can
satisfy
calorie
counters
with
its
wide
assortment
of
salads,
which
can
come
chopped
or
unchopped,
depending
on
your
preference.
For
waistline
watchers
who
find
small
portions
a
bit
challenging,
the
salads
offer
volume:
2½
cups
of
veggies,
including
spinach,
tomatoes,
green
peppers,
red
onions
and
cucumbers,
for
very
few
calories.
The
turkey
breast
and
Black
Forest
ham
salads
are
lowest
in
calories,
with
only
110
calories
each.
You
can
even
add
honey
mustard
dressing
without
significantly
boosting
the
calorie
load
(it
has
only
60
calories
per
serving).
If
you
prefer
a
sandwich,
turkey
comes
out
on
top
again
as
the
lowest-calorie
non-vegetarian
option
on
the
menu;
adding
honey
mustard
sauce
brings
the
total
sandwich
count
to
310
calories.
Add
apple
slices
to
your
salad
for
a
sweet
crunchy
snack,
and
your
total
meal
count
is
only
205
calories.
For
the
sugar-sensitive
Our
picks:
Turkey
breast
sandwich
with
Monterey
cheddar
cheese
on
toasted
multigrain
flatbread;
or
oven-roasted
chicken
salad;
or
tuna
salad
with
oil
and
vinegar
dressing
With
the
exception
of
sugary
beverages
and
desserts,
sugars
are
not
a
concern
at
Subway.
Most
of
the
chain's
sandwiches
and
salads
have
less
than
10%
of
calories
from
added
sugar.
Our
top
low-sugar
pick
is
the
turkey
breast
sandwich
with
cheddar
cheese
on
toasted
multigrain
flatbread,
which
has
only
5
grams
of
sugar.
Other
low-sugar
options
include
the
oven-roasted
chicken
salad
and
the
chopped
tuna
salad,
each
with
only
6
grams
of
sugar.
If
you're
watching
sugars,
you'll
want
to
steer
clear
of
the
sweet
onion
dressing,
which
contributes
16
grams,
or
4
teaspoons,
of
sugar
per
serving.
Top
either
salad
with
sugar-free
oil
and
vinegar
dressing
instead.
Additionally,
pair
your
salad
or
sub
with
water
or
unsweetened
tea
instead
of
sugar-sweetened
beverages.
And
try
to
tame
your
cravings
for
cookies:
Just
one
chocolate
chip
cookie
delivers
18
grams,
or
4½
teaspoons,
of
sugar.
For
the
salt-sensitive
Our
picks:
Veggie
Delite
salad
with
oil
and
vinegar
dressing;
or
Veggie
Delite
sandwich
on
nine-grain
wheat
bread
with
oil
and
vinegar
dressing;
or
oven-roasted
chicken
salad
with
oil
and
vinegar
dressing;
and
apple
slices
As
is
typically
the
case,
a
meatless
meal,
such
as
Subway's
Veggie
Delite
sandwich
or
the
related
salad
with
oil
and
vinegar
dressing,
will
naturally
be
lower
in
sodium.
However,
there
are
other
options
for
those
looking
to
limit
their
salt
intake.
One
we
like,
with
fewer
than
300
milligrams
of
sodium,
is
the
oven-roasted
chicken
salad
with
oil
and
vinegar.
You
can
add
avocado
if
it's
available,
as
it's
essentially
sodium-free.
However,
we
caution
you
to
be
careful
with
condiments
such
as
ranch
dressing
and
buffalo
sauce
(each
deliver
400
milligrams
of
sodium),
American
cheese
(it
adds
200
milligrams)
and
pickles
(115
milligrams).
Pair
your
meal
with
apple
slices
for
a
small
potassium
boost;
the
mineral
will
help
blunt
sodium's
effects
on
blood
pressure.
For
the
gluten-sensitive
Our
picks:
Rotisserie-style
chicken
salad
with
vinaigrette;
or
black
bean
soup;
or
broccoli
and
cheddar
soup
If
you're
avoiding
gluten
in
your
diet,
Subway's
salads
are
the
way
to
go.
The
chopped
salad
with
rotisserie-style
chicken
topped
with
Subway's
own
vinaigrette
--
a
blend
of
vinegar,
oregano,
garlic
and
pepper
--
is
one
of
our
favorites.
It's
packed
with
vegetables,
including
folate-rich
spinach,
and
provides
23
grams
of
lean
protein.
Other
options
with
no
gluten-containing
ingredients
include
the
black
bean
and
broccoli
and
cheddar
soups,
which
deliver
12
and
5
grams
of
protein,
respectively.
Also
worth
noting:
Approximately
5%
of
Subway
restaurants
offer
gluten-free
bread,
so
you
can
ask
for
your
sandwich
to
be
made
with
it
if
your
local
chain
offers
it.
(Note
that
even
when
gluten-free
bread
is
available,
sandwiches
are
not
labeled
"gluten-free"
due
to
the
risk
of
cross-contamination
with
products
that
include
gluten
in
the
store;
an
individual
with
celiac
disease
would
have
to
be
extra
cautious.)
For
the
athlete
Our
picks:
Rotisserie-style
chicken
sandwich
on
nine-grain
wheat
bread
with
honey
mustard
sauce;
or
roast
beef
sandwich
on
nine-grain
wheat
bread
with
mustard;
and
Gatorade
Whether
you
favor
weights,
sprints
or
long
cardio
routines,
Subway's
rotisserie-style
chicken
sandwich
can
meet
your
workout
needs.
It
offers
29
grams
of
protein
and
45
grams
of
carbs
to
fuel
and
repair
muscles.
We
also
like
the
roast
beef
sandwich
on
nine-grain
wheat
bread,
which
is
similar
in
terms
of
nutritional
value.
Athletes
with
bigger
appetites
can
order
a
footlong
sandwich
instead
of
6
inches,
if
more
calories
and
carbs
are
desired.
Additionally,
strength
trainers
can
take
advantage
of
the
chain's
"double
meat
option,"
which
gives
you
two
times
the
amount
of
protein
in
the
meal.
For
example,
doubling
the
amount
of
roast
beef
brings
the
protein
count
of
the
sandwich
from
25
grams
to
41
grams
(the
bread
contributes
some
protein,
too).
The
sodium
count
also
increases
significantly,
though,
so
we
recommend
proceeding
only
if
you
can
afford
the
extra
milligrams.
Grab
a
Gatorade
for
a
post-workout
beverage
to
replenish
electrolytes
lost
in
sweat.
For
the
road
warrior
Our
picks:
Oven-roasted
chicken
sandwich
on
nine-grain
wheat
bread
with
honey
mustard
sauce;
or
turkey
breast
sandwich
with
Swiss
cheese
on
toasted
multigrain
flatbread;
and
apple
slices
and
Baked
Lay's
chips
Subway's
sandwiches
are
great
for
grabbing
on
the
go.
We
like
the
oven-roasted
chicken
sandwich
with
honey
mustard
sauce,
which
has
23
grams
of
protein
and
5
grams
of
fiber
--
a
nutrient
combo
that
will
keep
you
sated
on
the
road.
If
you're
not
in
a
rush,
order
a
turkey
sandwich
with
shredded
cheddar,
and
ask
for
it
to
be
toasted
on
multigrain
flatbread.
For
a
snack
during
your
travels,
apples
are
still
the
healthiest
option,
though
we
understand
if
you
want
to
grab
some
Baked
Lay's,
too.
For
the
carb-conscious
Our
picks:
Carved
turkey
sandwich
without
bread;
or
club
with
scooped-out
bread;
oil
and
vinegar
dressing
Those
cutting
carbs
have
a
few
options
at
Subway:
you
can
order
a
salad
(though
most
dressings
and
veggies
still
contain
carbs),
order
a
sandwich
sans
bread
or
get
your
bread
scooped.
Keep
in
mind,
the
more
you
scoop,
the
more
you
save:
A
Subway
club
with
scooped-out
bread
still
has
39
grams
of
carbs
(compared
with
46
grams
in
the
non-scooped
version),
a
number
based
on
the
minimum
amount
of
bread
removed.
We
would
typically
save
the
carved
turkey
sandwich
for
November,
as
it's
higher
in
sodium
than
the
other
sandwiches.
However,
in
addition
to
slashing
40
grams
of
carbs,
omitting
the
bread
brings
the
sodium
count
down
to
620
milligrams
from
890
milligrams.
Olive
oil
and
vinegar
dressing
adds
flavor
without
any
carbs.
For
breakfast
Our
picks:
Egg
whites
with
Swiss
cheese,
spinach
and
tomato
on
multigrain
flatbread
If
you
have
a
hunch
that
breakfast
at
Subway
consists
of
breakfast
subs,
well,
you're
correct.
You
won't
find
oatmeal
or
even
yogurt
on
the
morning
menu.
The
point
of
differentiation
for
the
chain's
breakfast
offerings
comes
down
to
the
way
you
order
your
eggs
(both
eggs
and
egg
whites
are
available),
what
type
of
bread
you
choose
and
whether
you
add
cheese
or
meats
to
your
morning
sandwich.
We
favor
the
egg
white
sandwich
with
Swiss
cheese,
spinach
and
tomato
on
multigrain
flatbread,
which
is
packed
with
protein,
carbs
and
fiber
to
get
your
day
off
to
an
energizing
start.
