U.C.

does
not
allow
free
speech
and
practices
violence
on
innocent
people

-
NO
FEDERAL
FUNDS?CNN's
Jamiel
Lynch
and
Stephanie
Becker
contributed
to
this
report.
The
university
blamed
"150
masked
agitators"
for
the
unrest,
saying
they
had
come
to
campus
to
disturb
an
otherwise
peaceful
protest.
Two
Berkeley
College
Republicans
"were
attacked
while
conducting
an
interview"
on
the
campus
on
Thursday,
UC
Berkeley
also
said
in
a
prepared
statement.
The
attackers,
who
were
not
affiliated
with
the
university,
were
taken
into
custody
by
UC
Berkeley
police.
Administrators
decided
to
cancel
the
Wednesday
event
about
two
hours
before
the
Breitbart
editor's
speech.
UC
Berkeley
said
it
removed
him
from
campus
"amid
the
violence
and
destruction
of
property
and
out
of
concern
for
public
safety."
Black-clad
protesters
wearing
masks
threw
commercial-grade
fireworks
and
rocks
at
police.
Some
even
hurled
Molotov
cocktails
that
ignited
fires.
They
also
smashed
windows
of
the
student
union
center
on
the
Berkeley
campus
where
the
Yiannopoulos
event
was
to
be
held.
At
least
six
people
were
injured.
Some
were
attacked
by
the
agitators
--
who
are
a
part
of
an
anarchist
group
known
as
the
"Black
Bloc"
that
has
been
causing
problems
in
Oakland
for
years,
said
Dan
Mogulof,
UC
Berkeley
spokesman.
More
than
1,500
protesters
had
gathered
at
Sproul
Plaza,
chanting
and
holding
signs
that
read:
"No
safe
space
for
racists"
and
"This
is
war."
The
violent
protesters
tore
down
metal
barriers,
set
fires
near
the
campus
bookstore
and
damaged
the
construction
site
of
a
new
dorm.
One
woman
wearing
a
red
Trump
hat
was
pepper
sprayed
in
the
face
while
being
interviewed
by
CNN
affiliate
KGO.
She
was
able
to
respond
that
she
was
OK
after
the
attack.
As
the
scene
spiraled
out
of
control,
university
police
warned
protesters
to
disperse
and
issued
a
lockdown
for
campus
buildings.
"We
condemn
in
the
strongest
possible
terms
the
violence
and
unlawful
behavior
that
was
on
display
and
deeply
regret
that
those
tactics
will
now
overshadow
the
efforts
to
engage
in
legitimate
and
lawful
protest
against
the
performer's
presence
and
perspectives,"
UC
Berkeley
said
in
a
statement.
"While
Yiannopoulos'
views,
tactics
and
rhetoric
are
profoundly
contrary
to
our
own,
we
are
bound
by
the
Constitution,
the
law,
our
values
and
the
campus's
Principles
of
Community
to
enable
free
expression
across
the
full
spectrum
of
opinion
and
perspective,"
it
stated.
As
police
dispersed
the
crowd
from
campus,
a
remaining
group
of
protesters
moved
into
downtown
Berkeley
and
smashed
windows
at
several
local
banks.
No
arrests
were
made
throughout
the
night.
Yiannopoulos
on
college
speaking
tour
Yiannopoulos
had
been
invited
to
speak
by
the
Berkeley
College
Republicans.
He
has
been
on
a
college
speaking
tour
and
had
planned
to
speak
about
cultural
appropriation
on
Wednesday.
In
a
Facebook
Live
video,
Yiannopoulos
described
what
happened
as
"an
expression
of
political
violence."
"I'm
just
stunned
that
hundreds
of
people
...
were
so
threatened
by
the
idea
that
a
conservative
speaker
might
be
persuasive,
interesting,
funny
and
might
take
some
people
with
him,
they
have
to
shut
it
down
at
all
costs."
President
Donald
Trump
weighed
in
on
Twitter,
suggesting
the
possibility
of
cutting
federal
funds
to
the
public
university.
"If
U.C.
Berkeley
does
not
allow
free
speech
and
practices
violence
on
innocent
people
with
a
different
point
of
view
--
NO
FEDERAL
FUNDS?"
Trump
tweeted
Thursday
morning.
Later,
Yiannopoulos
posted
Trump's
tweet
to
Facebook
and
proclaimed
himself
"the
catalyst
for
this
change."
"American
universities
are
on
notice.
The
President
is
watching,"
he
wrote.
"The
days
you
could
silence
conservative
and
libertarian
voices
on
campus
and
still
expect
to
collect
their
tax
money
are
coming
to
an
end."
Yiannopoulos
trying
to
convince
colleges
hate
speech
is
cool
But
some
protesters
said
the
Yiannopoulos
event
wasn't
a
matter
of
free
speech,
because
he
espouses
hate
speech.
UC
Berkeley
said
it
had
prepared
security
measures
following
what
had
happened
at
Yiannopoulos'
previous
events.
One
of
his
planned
speaking
engagements
at
UC
Davis
was
also
canceled
last
month
in
response
to
protests.
"Ultimately,
and
unfortunately,
however,
it
was
impossible
to
maintain
order
given
the
level
of
threat,
disruption
and
organized
violence,"
UC
Berkeley
said
in
a
statement.
Controversial
speech
Most
UC
Berkeley
students
who
spoke
with
CNN
said
they
were
relieved
that
Yiannopoulos
wasn't
able
to
speak,
but
this
was
not
how
they
wanted
to
accomplish
that
goal.
One
student
told
CNN
that
he
didn't
agree
with
what
happened.
"It's
a
sad
irony
in
the
fact
that
the
Free
Speech
Movement
was
founded
here
and
tonight,
someone's
free
speech
got
shut
down.
It
might
have
been
hateful
speech,
but
it's
still
his
right
to
speak,"
said
Shivam
Patel,
a
freshmen
who
stood
outside
of
Sproul
Plaza.
The
Free
Speech
Movement
started
at
UC
Berkeley
in
1964
after
students
protested
en
masse
when
administrators
tried
to
restrict
their
political
activities
on
campus.
Patel
said
he
supported
peaceful
protests,
but
disagreed
with
the
way
things
turned
out
on
Wednesday.
"It
allows
people
on
the
right
to
say,
'Look
at
all
these
liberal
Berkeley
snowflakes.
They're
intolerant
of
speech.'
I
don't
think
it's
productive
at
all.
It
does
nothing
to
help
this
country."
