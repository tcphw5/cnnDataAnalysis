(CNN)The
US
ambassador
to
the
United
Nations
offered
a
strong
condemnation
of
Russia
in
her
first
appearance
at
the
UN
Security
Council
on
Thursday,
calling
on
Moscow
to
de-escalate
violence
in
eastern
Ukraine
and
saying
that
US
sanctions
against
Moscow
would
remain
in
place
until
it
withdraws
from
Crimea.Смерть

#UNSC
debut
speech
by
@NikkiHaley
today.
Fully
agree
that
sanctions
must
remain
until
#Russia
returns
control
of
#Crimea
to
#Ukraine.CNN's
Kevin
Liptak
contributed
to
this
report.
"The
United
States
continues
to
condemn
and
call
for
an
immediate
end
to
the
Russian
occupation
of
Crimea,"
said
Nikki
Haley,
President
Donald
Trump's
envoy
to
the
world
body.
"Crimea
is
a
part
of
Ukraine.
Our
Crimea-related
sanctions
will
remain
in
place
until
Russia
returns
control
over
the
peninsula
to
Ukraine."
Haley
was
speaking
at
an
emergency
UN
meeting
about
a
sudden
upsurge
in
violence
in
eastern
Ukraine,
where
Russian-backed
separatists
have
been
fighting
the
Ukrainian
army.
Her
remarks
were
notable
for
the
stark
difference
between
her
rhetoric
and
Trump's.
Sources
told
CNN
Thursday
evening
that
the
White
House
was
aware
in
advance
of
Haley's
speech.
A
source
told
CNN's
Dana
Bash
that
Haley
didn't
get
direction
from
the
White
House
but
she
wasn't
asked
not
do
to
it.
Another
source
told
CNN's
Elise
Labott
the
National
Security
Council
signed
off
on
the
remarks.
The
first
source
said
Haley
made
clear
in
private
conversations
as
well
as
during
her
confirmation
hearings
how
she
felt
about
hot
spots
like
Russia,
though
her
point
of
view
clearly
differs
from
some
of
what
the
President
said
during
the
campaign.
As
a
candidate,
the
President
hinted
he
might
recognize
Russia's
annexation
of
Crimea.
In
the
weeks
before
and
after
his
inauguration,
Trump's
refusal
to
condemn
Russian
hacking
during
the
election
and
his
attacks
on
the
intelligence
community
for
investigating
those
hacks
raised
questions
about
his
ties
to
Moscow.
Questions
only
deepened
after
CNN
reported
that
the
intelligence
community
was
looking
into
reports
that
Moscow
may
have
compromising
financial
and
personal
information
about
the
President.
Trump
has
insisted
that
he
would
simply
like
better
relations
with
Moscow.
At
a
news
conference
with
British
Prime
Minister
Theresa
May
last
week,
he
said
it
was
"too
early"
to
discuss
sanctions.
On
Thursday,
the
Treasury
Department
slightly
eased
a
sanction
the
Obama
administration
put
in
place
against
Russia's
Federal
Security
Service,
known
as
the
FSB.
A
top
State
Department
official
said
the
move
was
made
as
a
technical
fix
to
the
sanctions
that
were
put
in
place
to
avoid
"unintended
consequences"
of
US
government
business
with
Russia.
While
Washington
was
taking
that
step,
Haley
was
lobbing
verbal
grenades.
"I
consider
it
unfortunate
that
the
occasion
of
my
first
appearance
here
is
one
in
which
I
must
condemn
the
aggressive
actions
of
Russia,"
she
said.
"We
do
want
to
better
our
relations
with
Russia.
However,
the
dire
situation
in
eastern
Ukraine
is
one
that
demands
clear
and
strong
condemnation
of
Russian
actions."
"The
sudden
increase
in
fighting
in
eastern
Ukraine
has
trapped
thousands
of
civilians
and
destroyed
vital
infrastructure
and
the
crisis
is
spreading,
endangering
many
thousands
more,"
Haley
added.
"This
escalation
of
violence
must
stop."
At
one
point
in
the
charged
meeting,
Ukraine's
Ambassador
to
the
UN,
Volodymyr
Yelchenko,
held
up
a
photo
of
a
Ukraine
serviceman
who
was
killed
days
ago.
Looking
at
the
Russian
ambassador,
Yelchenko
said,
"You
killed
him."
While
Haley's
remarks
echoed
many
speeches
delivered
by
the
Obama
administration's
UN
ambassador,
Russia's
Ambassador
to
the
UN
Vitaly
Churkin
told
reporters
that
he
thinks
"there
is
a
change
in
tone"
with
the
new
US
administration.
He
added
that
he
wasn't
surprised
by
Haley's
speech.
Some
analysts
see
the
surge
in
fighting
as
a
Russian
test
of
US
resolve
or
perhaps
an
attempt
to
send
Ukraine
a
message
that
after
years
of
Obama
administration
support,
the
Trump
administration
will
be
more
friendly
to
Moscow
than
Kiev.
Fighting
between
Russian-backed
rebels
from
the
self-proclaimed
Donetsk
People's
Republic
and
the
Ukrainian
army
exploded
a
day
after
Trump
had
his
first
phone
call
with
Russian
President
Vladimir
Putin
on
Saturday.
Russia
accuses
Ukraine
of
starting
the
escalation.
Churkin
said
that
Ukraine
was
"desperately,
frantically
trying
to
achieve
a
military
settlement
to
the
conflict."
He
blamed
Kiev
for
the
recent
escalation,
saying
it
was
meant
to
keep
the
issue
"on
the
international
agenda"
and
"at
the
same
time
suck
in
with
their
reckless
confrontational
policy
newly
elected
heads
of
state."
The
UK
Ambassador
to
the
UN,
Matthew
Rycroft,
told
the
UN
meeting
that
"we
frequently
hear
from
the
Russian
government,
as
we
did
today,
that
all
the
problems
in
eastern
Ukraine
are
the
consequence
of
actions
by
the
Ukrainian
government.
This
is
simply
not
the
case.
It
is
an
inversion
of
reality."
He
later
tweeted,
"Great
#UNSC
debut
speech
by
@NikkiHaley
today.
Fully
agree
that
sanctions
must
remain
until
#Russia
returns
control
of
#Crimea
to
#Ukraine."
Balazs
Jarabik,
a
non-resident
fellow
at
the
Carnegie
Endowment
who
studies
Central
and
Eastern
Europe,
notes
that
the
rebels
used
rockets
that
were
in
flagrant
violation
of
the
Minsk
Agreement,
a
ceasefire
pact
meant
to
end
the
fighting.
"Why
did
they
violate
it
so
visibly?"
Jarabik
asked.
"I
think
there's
merit
to
the
speculation
that
the
Russians
wanted
to
show
that
Kiev
doesn't
have
the
backing
it
used
to
have
from
the
US."
And
initially,
the
US
response
was
seen
as
tepid
at
best.
A
January
31
statement
from
the
State
Department
condemned
the
violence,
but
didn't
mention
Russia
or
contain
the
statement
of
support
for
Ukraine
that
was
customary
during
the
Obama
administration.
"There
was
panicking"
in
Ukraine
after
that
statement,
Jarabik
said,
speaking
from
Kiev.
"There
were
Ukrainian
pundits
saying
it's
the
end
of
US
support
--
because
it
had
such
a
different
tone
than
the
Obama
administration.
The
so-called
unwavering
support
seemed
gone.
It
was
sending
shock
waves."
Lawmakers
on
both
sides
of
the
aisle
have
long
called
for
a
more
supportive
approach
to
Ukraine.
They
often
criticized
the
Obama
administration
for
its
refusal
to
provide
Kiev
with
defensive
weapons.
On
Thursday,
Republican
Sen.
Marco
Rubio
of
Florida
called
again
for
the
US
to
provide
weapons.
"Vladimir
Putin's
continued
aggression
against
the
people
of
Ukraine
is
outrageous,
and
further
destabilization
in
the
region
will
have
profound
negative
consequences
for
us
here
in
America,"
Rubio
told
CNN.
He
noted
that
Trump's
new
Secretary
of
State
Rex
Tillerson
and
Secretary
of
Defense
James
Mattis
both
advocated
during
their
confirmation
hearings
for
providing
Ukraine
with
weapons
to
defend
its
sovereign
territory.
"I
hope
President
Trump
will
heed
their
advice,"
Rubio
said.
"We
must
stand
with
the
people
of
Ukraine
during
this
difficult
hour
and
make
clear
to
Putin
that
relations
will
not
improve
until
Russia
respects
Ukraine's
sovereignty."
Democratic
Sen.
Robert
Menendez
of
New
Jersey
drew
a
link
between
Trump's
mollifying
approach
to
Russia
and
the
aggression
in
Ukraine.
"At
the
mere
hint
that
President
Trump
would
take
a
softer
stance
towards
Russia,
we
have
already
seen
pro-Russian
forces
emboldened
and
renew
fighting"
in
eastern
Ukraine,
he
told
CNN.
Menendez
is
part
of
a
bipartisan
group
of
senators
who
have
introduced
the
Countering
Russian
Hostilities
Act,
which
he
said
would
hold
Russia
accountable
for
its
international
aggression
and
interference
in
the
US
election.
"I
sincerely
hope
both
the
Trump
administration
and
Congressional
Republicans
don't
make
the
mistake
of
walking
away
from
longstanding,
responsible
policies
to
counter
Russian
aggression,"
he
said.
