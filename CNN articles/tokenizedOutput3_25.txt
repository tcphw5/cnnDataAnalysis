The
Oscar-winning
actor
suggested
as
much
in
a
recent
interview
with
the
BBC's
Andrew
Marr
to
promote
his
new
film,
"Gold."
Marr
said
it
seems
that
a
theme
of
the
film
is
"small
time,
central
redneck
America
sticking
one
up
to
the
snotty
East
Coast
elites,
as
it
were."
He
then
noted
that
many
actors
and
artists
"dump
on
Trump"
and
asked
McConaughey
whether
it's
time
to
give
Trump
a
break.
"Well,
they
don't
have
a
choice
now,
he's
our
President,"
McConaughey
said.
"It's
very
dynamic
and
as
divisive
of
an
inauguration
and
time
that
we've
ever
had.
At
the
same
time,
it's
time
for
us
to
embrace
and
shake
hands
with
this
fact
and
be
constructive
with
him
over
the
next
four
years."
No
matter
how
much
people
may
have
disagreed
with
candidate
Trump,
McConaughey
said,
it's
now
"time
to
think
about
how
constructive
can
you
be
because
he's
our
President
for
the
next
four
years
at
least."
The
star's
remarks
were
hailed
and
criticized
on
social
media.
It
is
unclear
whether
the
interview
was
taped
before
or
after
Trump's
issued
his
controversial
travel
ban.
McConaughey's
wife,
model
Camila
Alves,
was
born
in
Brazil
and
became
a
US
citizen
in
2015.
CNN
has
reached
out
to
reps
for
the
actor
for
comment.
