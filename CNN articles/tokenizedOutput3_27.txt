(CNN)The
congregation
of
the
Victoria
Islamic
Center
in
Texas
was
devastated.
Its
mosque
was
destroyed
over
the
weekend
in
a
fire,
the
cause
of
which
is
unknown.CNN's
Jamiel
Lynch
contributed
to
this
story.Then
an
act
of
kindness
revived
their
spirits
--
the
leaders
of
the
local
Jewish
congregation
gave
them
the
keys
to
their
synagogue
so
they
could
continue
to
worship.
The
leader
of
the
mosque
said
he
wasn't
surprised
by
the
gesture.
"I
never
doubted
the
support
that
we
were
going
to
get"
after
the
fire,
Dr.
Shahid
Hashmi,
a
surgeon
and
president
of
Victoria
Islamic
Center,
told
CNN.
"We've
always
had
a
good
relationship
with
the
community
here."
Hashmi
said
Dr.
Gary
Branfman
--
a
member
of
Temple
B'nai
Israel
in
Victoria,
as
well
as
a
fellow
surgeon
and
friend
--
just
came
by
his
house
and
gave
him
the
keys.
Support
from
around
the
world
And
that
wasn't
the
only
offer
of
a
temporary
worship
space
that
was
extended.
Hashmi
said
three
local
churches
said
his
congregation
could
use
their
buildings.
Also
offered
up
was
an
empty
office
building,
which
the
congregation
used
for
three
days
before
moving
into
a
mobile
home
on
the
mosque
property,
Hashmi
said.
"It's
a
beautiful
community,"
he
said.
Though
Hashmi
always
knew
his
own
east
Texas
community
would
support
the
mosque,
he
was
stunned
by
the
outpouring
of
support
from
people
outside
Victoria.
So
far,
a
GoFundMe
page
set
up
to
help
raise
money
for
the
mosque's
reconstruction
has
taken
in
more
than
$1
million.
That's
on
top
of
other
donations
the
congregation
has
received
from
people
in
90
different
countries.
"We
were
surprised
at
the
donations
from
around
the
world,"
Hashmi
told
CNN.
'Humanity
at
its
best'
The
Muslim
community
in
Victoria
dates
back
decades,
Hashmi
said,
but
the
mosque
was
just
16
years
old.
Thanks
to
all
of
the
financial
contributions,
he
expects
they'll
be
able
to
rebuild
it
in
less
than
a
year.
Hashmi
said
the
congregants
at
the
mosque
are
still
in
shock
over
the
fire.
Officials
with
the
Texas
State
Fire
Marshal's
Office
say
no
cause
has
been
determined
yet,
and
it
may
be
weeks
or
months
before
can
they
figure
out
what
happened,
including
whether
the
fire
was
deliberately
set.
But
the
love
that
has
grown
from
tragedy
is
making
all
the
difference.
"It's
given
us
a
sense
of
hope,"
Omar
Rachid,
a
member
of
the
Muslim
congregation,
told
CNN.
"It's
humanity
at
its
best."
