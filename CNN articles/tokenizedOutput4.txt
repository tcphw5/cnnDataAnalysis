it
unfolds.Washington
(CNN)President
Donald
Trump's
administration
enacted
new
sanctions
on
Iran
Friday,
the
first
concrete
action
after
the
White
House
put
Tehran
"on
notice"
this
week.The
Treasury
Department
said
it
was
applying
sanctions
on
25
individuals
and
companies
connected
to
Iran's
ballistic
missile
program
and
those
providing
support
to
Iran's
Islamic
Revolutionary
Guard
Corps'
Qods
Force.
That
included
three
separate
networks
linked
to
supporting
the
missile
program,
which
the
US
opposes.
The
moves
come
as
punishment
for
the
country's
test
launch
of
a
ballistic
missile
last
weekend.
National
Security
Adviser
Michael
Flynn
said
the
move
was
"provocative"
and
in
defiance
of
a
United
Nations
Security
Council
resolution
that
bars
Iran
from
taking
steps
on
a
ballistic
missile
program
capable
of
launching
nuclear
weapons.
"They're
not
behaving,"
Trump
said
of
Iran
in
the
Oval
Office
on
Friday
as
he
signed
unrelated
executive
orders.
National
Security
Adviser
Michael
Flynn
issued
a
statement
on
the
new
sanctions,
saying
that
the
"international
community
has
been
too
tolerant
of
Iran's
bad
behavior."
"The
days
of
turning
a
blind
eye
to
Iran's
hostile
and
belligerent
actions
toward
the
United
States
and
the
world
community
are
over,"
Flynn
said.
The
new
sanctions
are
designed
not
to
impede
upon
the
Iran
nuclear
deal,
which
the
US
and
five
other
world
powers
signed
with
Tehran
during
President
Barack
Obama's
tenure.
That
plan
allowed
for
the
lifting
of
major
sanctions
against
Iran
in
exchange
for
a
curtailment
of
its
nuclear
program.
Administration
officials
said
Friday
the
new
round
of
sanctions
does
not
affect
any
individual
or
firm
that
had
sanctions
lifted
as
part
of
the
nuclear
accord.
The
officials
said
that
new
deals
between
US
companies
and
Iran,
like
an
agreement
with
Boeing
for
a
new
fleet
of
jets,
were
not
likely
to
be
affected
by
the
sanctions.
Iran
dismisses
Trump's
'ranting'
and
vows
more
missile
tests
Tehran,
however,
responded
by
saying
the
moves
were
in
violation
of
the
nuclear
agreement,
calling
them
"illegal"
and
"extraterritorial."
The
sanctions
are
"contrary
to
the
obligations
of
the
United
States,"
according
to
the
country's
official
news
agency
IRNA,
which
cited
the
foreign
ministry.
Iran's
missile
program
is
purely
for
"defensive
purposes,"
the
foreign
ministry
said.
Trump's
Press
Secretary
Sean
Spicer
said
Friday
the
White
House
would
continue
responding
to
any
Iranian
provocations
going
forward.
But
he
said
the
moves
illustrate
the
pitfalls
of
the
nuclear
agreement.
"Today's
sanctions
really
represent
a
very,
very
strong
stance
against
the
actions
that
Iran
has
been
taking,
and
make
it
very
clear
that
the
deal
that
they
struck
previously
was
not
in
the
best
interest
of
this
country,
and
that
President
Trump
is
going
to
do
everything
he
can
to
make
sure
that
Iran
is
stayed
in
check,"
Spicer
said.
The
detailed
announcement
from
the
Treasury
Department
on
Friday
reflected
months
of
work,
US
officials
said,
dating
to
before
Trump
took
office.
"Treasury
has
likely
been
working
on
these
Iran
sanctions
for
months,"
said
a
congressional
aide.
US
officials
said
the
deliberative
process
was
"totally
normal,"
despite
the
new
administration
still
filling
key
national
security
roles.
Friday's
announcement
represents
the
first
concrete
step
in
what
the
Trump
administration
has
vowed
will
be
a
more
aggressive
approach
to
Iran.
Trump
on
Thursday
refused
to
rule
out
military
action
against
Iran,
saying
that
"nothing
is
off
the
table"
when
it
comes
to
confronting
destabilizing
behavior
from
the
country.
While
Obama
also
refused
to
rule
out
military
action,
Trump's
rhetoric
reflects
a
scaled-up
posture.
On
the
campaign
trail,
Trump
railed
against
the
nuclear
deal,
though
his
aides
have
offered
a
more
muted
view
after
he
took
office.
An
official
who
briefed
reporters
this
week
suggested
the
agreement,
known
as
the
Joint
Comprehensive
Plan
of
Action,
would
remain
in
place
for
now.
In
a
letter
to
Trump
Thursday,
a
bipartisan
group
of
senators
had
encouraged
aggressive
action
against
Iran
as
a
rebuttal
to
its
missile
launches
and
support
for
terror
organizations.

rips
'irresponsible'
Iran
after
missile
test
"Iranian
leaders
must
feel
sufficient
pressure
to
cease
deeply
destabilizing
activities,
from
sponsoring
terrorist
groups
to
continued
testing
of
ballistic
missiles,"
the
lawmakers
wrote.
"Full
enforcement
of
existing
sanctions
and
the
imposition
of
additional
sanctions
on
Iran
for
its
ballistic
missile
program
are
necessary,"
the
letter
said.
On
Friday,
the
move
drew
swift
praise
from
Republicans
on
Capitol
Hill.
"Iran's
dangerous
and
provocative
acts
are
a
direct
threat
to
the
United
States
and
our
allies,"
said
House
Foreign
Affairs
Committee
Chairman
Ed
Royce
in
a
statement.
"I'm
glad
the
administration
is
taking
long-overdue
steps
to
hold
the
regime
accountable."
The
new
sanctions
designate
Abdollah
Asgharzadeh,
an
Iranian
businessman
whom
the
Treasury
Department
accused
of
acting
as
a
procurement
agent
for
the
ballistic
missile
program.
It
also
singled
out
individuals
within
Asgharzadeh's
network.
Iran
to
take
'reciprocal
measures'
after
Trump's
immigration
order
Other
entities
that
were
targeted
Friday
include
trading
networks
associated
with
Iran's
missile
program
and
a
network
accused
of
providing
cash
transfers
to
Hezbollah,
the
Lebanon-based
terror
group.
The
Treasury
Department
said
it
was
freezing
all
US
assets
for
those
individuals
and
prohibiting
Americans
from
doing
business
with
them.
A
US
official
said
the
individuals
who
came
under
sanction
on
Friday
have
"touch
points"
in
the
US
financial
system,
but
couldn't
detail
their
exact
exposure
in
the
United
States
or
the
precise
impact
the
sanctions
will
have
monetarily.
The
sanctions
on
Iranian
individuals
and
companies
were
issued
under
an
existing
executive
order
that
Trump's
two
predecessors,
George
W.
Bush
and
Barack
Obama,
also
used
to
punish
the
country
for
test
launches,
most
recently
in
January
2016.
A
US
official
said
Friday
that
Washington
would
continue
its
response
to
actions
it
deems
provocative
from
Iran.
"Iran
has
to
determine
its
response
to
our
actions,"
the
official
said,
adding
"Iran
has
a
choice
to
make.
We
are
going
to
continue
to
respond
to
their
behavior
in
an
ongoing
way,
at
an
appropriate
level,
to
continue
to
pressure
them
to
change
their
behavior."
