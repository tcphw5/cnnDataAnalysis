(CNN)President
Trump
is
taking
a
prostate
drug
often
prescribed
for
hair
loss,
his
physician
Dr.
Harold
N.
Bornstein
told
the
New
York
Times
in
an
interview
published
Wednesday.
He
also
made
a
point
of
stating
that
the
President
has
all
of
his
hair.

on

and

New
York
City
gastroenterologist
also
said
the
President
is
taking
antibiotics
to
control
rosacea,
a
skin
condition
that
causes
redness.
A
senior
White
House
official
says
Bornstein
did
not
have
Trump's
permission
to
speak
about
his
health
to
the
Times.
The
physician
told
the
Times
he
has
had
no
contact
with
his
patient
since
Trump
became
president.
Trump
had
visited
his
office
every
year
since
1980
for
annual
checkups,
colonoscopies
and
other
routine
tests.
During
the
campaign,
Trump's
longtime
physician
disclosed
only
that
he
was
taking
rosuvastatin
and
low-dose
aspirin
to
reduce
his
risk
of
heart
attack.
Bornstein
came
under
scrutiny
for
a
letter
he
wrote
describing
Trump's
physical
health
that
concluded,
"If
elected,
Mr.
Trump,
I
can
state
unequivocally,
will
be
the
healthiest
individual
ever
elected
to
the
presidency."
Other
doctors
found
the
letter's
conclusion
unprofessional
and
said
Bornstein
had
used
strange
wording
and
medically
incorrect
terms
when
referring
to
his
high-profile
patient.
Bornstein
told
CNN
in
September
that
he
was
rushed
for
time
and
had
patients
to
see
when
writing
the
letter.
What
is
Propecia?
Propecia
is
a
lower-dose
formulation
of
finasteride
that
is
prescribed
to
men
with
enlarged
prostate
glands
under
the
brand
name
Proscar.
Originally,
the
Food
and
Drug
Administration
approved
finasteride
5
mg
(Proscar)
in
1992
for
the
treatment
of
"bothersome
symptoms
in
men"
with
an
enlarged
prostate,
which
is
also
referred
to
as
benign
prostatic
hyperplasia.
At
that
time,
the
FDA
also
approved
Proscar
to
reduce
the
need
for
surgery
related
to
an
enlarged
prostate
and
possible
urine
retention.
In
1997,
the
agency
approved
a
lower-dose
formulation
of
finasteride
(Propecia)
for
the
treatment
of
male
pattern
hair
loss,
a
gradual
thinning
that
leads
to
either
a
receding
hairline
or
balding
on
the
top
of
the
head.
The
FDA
does
not
permit
Propecia
for
treating
hair
loss
in
women
or
children.
"It
is
a
very
common
medication,"
said
Dr.
Louis
Kavoussi,
chairman
of
urology
at
Northwell
Health
in
New
Hyde
Park,
NY.
He
added
that
finasteride
has
been
around
for
decades,
so
its
long-term
safety
has
been
demonstrated.
The
drug,
which
blocks
the
body's
production
of
male
hormones,
is
in
a
class
of
medications
called
5-alpha
reductase
inhibitors.
"The
effectiveness
varies,"
said
Kavoussi,
who
has
no
ties
to
Merck
or
the
companies
that
make
generic
versions
of
finasteride.
Though
some
men
who
take
it
for
hair
loss
find
it
"very
effective,"
others
do
not.
"Same
for
prostate,"
he
said.
"Some
men
gain
quite
a
bit
of
symptom
relief,
other
men
more
modest.
It
depends
on
the
patient."
Possible
side
effects
of
the
finasteride
include
decreased
libido,
problems
with
erection
and
ejaculation,
pain
in
the
testicles
and
depression.
According
to
drugmaker
Merck's
prescribing
information,
patients
taking
the
drug
should
promptly
notify
their
doctor
if
they
experience
changes
in
their
breasts,
rash,
itching,
hives,
swelling
of
the
face
or
hands,
or
difficulty
breathing
or
swallowing.
According
to
Kavoussi,
"most
men
tolerate
it
pretty
well."
Those
who
do
get
side
effects
simply
stop
taking
the
medicine,
and
the
effects
resolve.
For
some
years,
Merck
has
been
a
defendant
in
liability
lawsuits
regarding
Propecia/Proscar.
About
1,370
lawsuits
have
been
filed
as
of
September
30
by
people
who
claim
that
they
have
experienced
persistent
sexual
side
effects
after
cessation
of
treatment
with
Propecia
and/or
Proscar.
About
50
of
the
plaintiffs
also
allege
that
the
drug
has
caused
or
can
cause
prostate
cancer,
testicular
cancer
or
male
breast
cancer.
Dr.
Irwin
Goldstein,
founder
of
San
Diego
Sexual
Medicine,
is
serving
as
an
expert
witness
against
Merck
in
the
ligation,
work
for
which
he
is
being
paid.
He
said
people
come
to
his
clinic
"from
all
over
the
world"
for
help
with
finasteride-associated
symptoms.
Many
patients
experience
"a
sudden
or
significant
change
in
libido,"
he
said,
while
another
common
side
effect
is
erectile
dysfunction.
Along
with
these
sexual
effects,
Goldstein
said
the
drug
can
cause
problems
with
both
mood
and
cognition,
including
harmful
effects
on
memory
and
decision-making.
Some
patients
believe
they
suffer
from
"post-finasteride
syndrome,"
in
which
their
symptoms
continue
after
they
stop
taking
the
drug.
As
of
March
2015,
the
syndrome
is
listed
on
the
National
Institutes
of
Health's
Genetic
and
Rare
Diseases
Information
Center,
with
the
disclaimer
that
this
is
not
intended
as
"official
recognition"
of
the
syndrome.
Still,
the
National
Institutes
of
Health
has
sponsored
studies,
which
are
now
underway,
to
better
understand
the
effects
of
finasteride.
"You
don't
want
people
to
shy
away
--
and
that's
the
bad
thing
about
lawsuits;
people
get
the
impression
that
something
is
very
bad,"
Kavoussi
said,
adding,
"it's
helped
a
lot
of
men."
Merck
listed
2015
sales
of
the
drug
at
$183
million,
down
from
a
peak
of
$447
million
in
2010.
Other
drug
manufacturers
began
producing
generic
versions
in
2013.
Efforts
to
contact
Bornstein
for
comment
have
not
been
successful.
