(CNN)Drivers
fly
all
sorts
of
flags
from
their
vehicles,
but
it's
not
every
day
you
see
a
military
convoy
sporting
something
other
than
the
US
flag.A
Trump
flag
was
spotted
on
a
military
convoy
driving
outside
Louisville,
Kentucky,
on
Sunday.
The
US
Navy
confirmed
to
CNN
that
the
Humvees
were
being
driven
by
an
East
Coast
Naval
Special
Warfare
unit
--
also
known
as
a
Navy
SEALs
unit.
Flying
certain
flags
from
military
vehicles
is
allowed,
but
a
blue
Trump
flag
waving
in
the
wind
is
not
one
of
them.
"Department
of
Defense
and
Navy
regulations
prescribe
flags
and
pennants
that
may
be
displayed
as
well
as
the
manner
of
display,"
said
Navy
Public
Affairs
Officer
Lt.
Jacqui
Maxwell.
"The
flag
shown
in
the
video
was
unauthorized."
The
Navy
has
started
a
command
inquiry
on
this
incident.
The
Humvees
in
the
video
are
based
in
Fort
Knox,
Kentucky,
she
added.
The
convoy
was
traveling
between
two
military
training
areas.
The
Facebook
video
showing
the
convoy
had
been
viewed
almost
80,000
times
before
it
was
removed
Thursday
afternoon.
The
responses
to
the
video
were
harsh,
with
some
people
blasting
the
person
who
filmed
it
while
driving,
to
others
who
told
the
world
to
get
used
to
President
Trump
being
the
commander
in
chief.
"Good
lord,
get
over
it
already,
he's
the
president
and
it
will
be
that
way
for
4
years!!"
said
one
Facebook
commenter.
