(CNN)Adolf
Hitler's
telephone,
recovered
from
the
Fuhrerbunker
and
kept
in
a
box
at
an
English
country
house
since
1945,
will
be
sold
at
auction
in
the
United
States
later
this
month.The
phone
was
presented
to
Hitler
by
the
Wehrmacht
and
was
used
by
the
Nazi
leader
to
issue
most
of
his
commands
during
the
last
two
years
of
World
War
II,
according
to
a
description
in
the
catalog
for
Alexander
Historical
Auctions
in
Maryland.
Made
by
Siemens
as
a
black
Bakelite
phone,
it
was
later
painted
red
and
engraved
with
Hitler's
name
and
a
swastika,
the
catalog
says.
The
auction
house
describes
the
telephone
as
"Hitler's
mobile
device
of
destruction"
and
called
it
"arguably
the
most
destructive
'weapon'
of
all
time,
which
sent
millions
to
their
deaths
around
the
world."
British
officer
Ralph
Rayner
recovered
the
phone
from
Hitler's
bunker
while
visiting
Berlin
on
the
orders
of
Field
Marshall
Bernard
Montgomery
just
a
few
days
after
the
end
of
the
war,
according
to
Rayner's
personal
account
and
shipping
documents
from
that
time
period,
according
to
the
auction
house.
His
son
Ranulf
Rayner,
82,
inherited
the
phone
after
his
father's
death
in
1977.
"My
father
didn't
see
it
as
a
relic
of
Hitler's
glory
days,
more
a
battered
remnant
of
his
defeat,
a
sort
of
war
trophy,"
he
told
CNN.
"He
never
thought
it
would
become
an
important
artifact."
Sent
to
the
shattered
German
capital
to
establish
contact
with
the
Russian
forces
who
had
captured
the
city,
Ralph
Rayner
was
probably
the
very
first
non-Soviet
victor
to
enter
Hitler's
bunker.
"He
could
still
smell
burning
flesh,"
Ranulf
Rayner
said,
recalling
his
father's
description
of
the
underground
shelter
where
Hitler
spent
his
final
days.
In
his
words,
it
was
a
"dreadful
hellhole."
First
offered
the
black
telephone
found
in
the
room
of
Eva
Braun,
Hitler's
bride,
Ralph
Rayner
instead
chose
the
red
phone
next
to
Hitler's
bed.
"He
told
the
Russians
that
red
was
his
favorite
color,"
Ranulf
Rayner
said,
"which
the
Russians
rather
liked."
In
a
letter
to
his
wife
Elizabeth
on
May
18,
1945,
Ralph
Rayner
wrote
of
the
"utter
horror"
he
witnessed
in
Berlin,
but
did
not
mention
the
remarkable
souvenir
he
had
in
his
possession.
If
British
soldiers
were
caught
looting
from
the
Germans,
Ranulf
Rayner
explained,
they
would
face
a
court
martial.
Ralph
Rayner
returned
to
Devon
in
western
England
with
both
the
phone
and
a
porcelain
model
of
an
Alsatian,
also
taken
from
the
bunker,
hidden
in
his
suitcase.
The
china
dog,
made
by
slave
laborers
at
Dachau
concentration
camp
and
probably
presented
to
Hitler
by
Heinrich
Himmler,
SS
chief
and
architect
of
the
Final
Solution,
is
also
due
to
be
auctioned.
"It's
a
pretty
nasty
thing,
just
as
sinister
as
the
phone,"
said
Ranulf
Rayner.
He
hopes
these
objects
will
be
bought
by
a
museum,
rather
than
a
private
collector.
"I
don't
want
them
to
be
hidden
again,"
he
said.
"I
want
them
to
remind
the
world
of
the
horrors
of
war."
The
auction
house
estimates
the
phone
will
be
sold
for
$200,000-$300,000
and
the
Alsatian
figure
for
$25,000-$35,000.
