(CNN)Most
of
the
time,
when
you
order
fast
food,
you
know
exactly
what
you're
getting:
an
inexpensive
meal
that
tastes
great
but
is
probably
loaded
with
fat,
cholesterol
and
sodium.See

latest

and
share
your

with
CNN
Health
on
Facebook
and
Twitter.But
it
turns
out
that
the
packaging
your
food
comes
in
could
also
have
a
negative
impact
on
your
health,
according
to
a
report
published
Wednesday
in
the
journal
Environmental
Science
&
Technology
Letters.
The
report
found
fluorinated
chemicals
in
one-third
of
the
fast
food
packaging
researchers
tested.
These
chemicals
are
favored
for
their
grease-repellent
properties.
Along
with
their
use
in
the
fast
food
industry,
fluorinated
chemicals
--
sometimes
called
PFASs
--
are
used
"to
give
water-repellant,
stain-resistant,
and
non-stick
properties
to
consumer
products
such
as
furniture,
carpets,
outdoor
gear,
clothing,
cosmetics
(and)
cookware,"
according
to
a
news
release
that
accompanied
the
report.
"The
most
studied
of
these
substances
(PFOSs
and
PFOAs)
has
been
linked
to
kidney
and
testicular
cancer,
elevated
cholesterol,
decreased
fertility,
thyroid
problems
and
changes
in
hormone
functioning,
as
well
as
adverse
developmental
effects
and
decreased
immune
response
in
children."
These
are
long-chain
PFASs
that
have
largely
been
phased
out,
in
favor
of
shorter-chain
compounds
that
are
thought
to
have
shorter
half-lives
in
the
human
body,
but
these
shortened
forms
have
not
yet
been
thoroughly
studied.
As
these
chemicals
are
used
in
many
everyday
products,
consumers
are
exposed
to
them
frequently,
and
the
same
health
effects
may
not
be
true
for
all
of
them.
Previous
studies
have
shown
that
PFASs
can
migrate
from
food
packaging
into
the
food
you
eat,
said
Laurel
Schaider,
a
research
scientist
at
the
Silent
Spring
Institute
and
one
of
the
authors
of
the
paper.
"These
studies
have
found
that
the
extent
of
migration
depends
on
the
temperature
of
the
food,
the
type
of
food
and
how
long
the
food
is
in
contact
with
the
paper,"
Schaider
said.
"And
it
depends
on
which
specific
chemical"
is
in
the
packaging.
What
constitutes
a
bad
(w)rap?
Scientists
at
the
five
institutions
that
collaborated
on
the
report
collected
more
than
400
samples
of
fast
food
packaging
from
27
leading
US
chains.
The
types
of
packaging
were
split
into
six
categories:
food
contact
paper
(sandwich
wrappers
and
pastry
bags),
food
contact
paperboard
(boxes
for
fries
or
pizza),
non-contact
paper
(outer
bags),
paper
cups,
other
beverage
containers
(milk
and
juice
containers)
and
miscellaneous
(lids).
Food
contact
papers
were
divided
into
three
subcategories:
sandwiches,
burgers
and
fried
foods;
Tex-Mex;
and
desserts
and
breads.
Food
contact
paper
fared
the
worst,
with
46%
of
all
samples
testing
positive
for
fluorine.
Food
contact
paperboard
was
next,
at
20%,
followed
by
other
beverage
containers
at
16%.
Non-contact
paper,
paper
cups
and
miscellaneous
all
tested
negative
for
fluorine.
The
researchers
did
not
provide
any
chain-specific
data
in
order
to
compare
fast
food
restaurants
or
determine
which
brands
scored
better
or
worse
than
average.
"For
foodservice
packaging
that
requires
a
barrier
coating,
'short
chain'
fluorochemicals
are
used
today,
so
it's
no
surprise
that
the
study
would
find
these
chemicals,"
said
Lynn
M.
Dyer,
President
of
the
Foodservice
Packaging
Institute
in
the
US.
"These,
like
all
packaging
products,
go
through
rigorous
testing
to
ensure
that
they
meet
stringent
US
Food
and
Drug
Administration
regulations,
providing
the
safe
delivery
of
foods
and
beverages
to
consumers."
Dryer
added,
however,
that
"some
fluorochemical-free
products
have
been
introduced
since
this
study
was
conducted
in
2014
and
2015,"
meaning
there
are
now
a
greater
numbers
of
options
available
for
fast
food
chains
to
provide
oil,
grease
and/or
water
resistance.
What's
a
consumer
to
do?
Short
of
asking
that
your
next
burger
be
served
in
between
two
lids,
there
isn't
a
whole
lot
you
can
do
to
avoid
PFAS
exposure
once
you've
chosen
to
eat
at
a
fast
food
restaurant.
"Unfortunately,
for
consumers,
there's
no
easy
way
to
tell
--
just
by
looking
at
packaging
--
whether
or
not
it
contains
fluorinated
chemicals,"
Schaider
said.
"For
people
who
wish
to
reduce
their
exposure
to
these
chemicals,
they
may
be
able
to
take
some
steps
...
to
reduce
that
migration
from
packaging
into
food
--
for
instance,
by
taking
the
food
out
of
the
packaging
sooner
rather
than
later."
You
could
also
ask
that
your
fries
or
dessert
be
served
in
a
paper
cup
or
a
noncontact
paper
bag.
This
is
the
outer
bag
all
your
items
are
usually
put
into
when
you
get
your
food.
More
than
anything,
Schaider
urges
consumers
to
put
pressure
on
their
favorite
fast
food
chains
to
switch
to
packaging
that
doesn't
contain
fluorinated
chemicals.
"I
think
that
this
study
provides
yet
another
reason
to
support
the
idea
that
eating
more
fresh
food
and
more
home-cooked
meals
is
better
for
our
health,"
she
said,
"but
it's
hard
to
avoid
the
convenience
of
fast
food,
especially
in
people's
busy
lives."
