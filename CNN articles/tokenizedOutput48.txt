(CNN)The
leader
of
France's
far-right
Front
National
party,
Marine
Le
Pen,
has
applauded
US
President
Donald
Trump's
controversial
travel
ban
and
said
a
backlash
to
the
measure
was
in
"bad
faith."He
was
elected
and
he
said
that
he
was
going
to
do
this.
And
now
the
world
seems
to
be
scandalized
because
he's
implementing
what
he
promised
he
would
do
during
his
campaign.Marine

the
interview
with
Marine
Le
Pen
on
CNN
International's
Amanpour
at
2pm
ET.
Trump
signed
an
executive
order
Friday
barring
citizens
of
seven
Muslim-majority
countries
from
entering
the
United
States
for
the
next
90
days
and
suspending
the
admission
of
all
refugees
for
120
days.
The
order
also
indefinitely
suspends
the
Syrian
refugee
program.
Dubbed
a
"Muslim
ban"
by
many,
the
order
has
been
condemned
by
the
countries
affected
and
Western
European
leaders.
"I
think
that
most
of
the
reactions
are
in
bad
faith,"
Le
Pen,
who
is
expected
to
be
a
frontrunner
in
France's
presidential
elections
in
April
and
May,
told
CNN's
Christiane
Amanpour.
"It
is
a
temporary
measure.
It
targets
six
or
seven
countries,
countries
that
of
course
are
responsible
for
terrorist
threats.
"So
I
think
Donald
Trump
and
his
intelligence
services
wanted
to
set
up
criteria
and
conditions
to
avoid
having
potential
terrorists
enter
the
United
States,
where
they
might
commit
attacks,
the
same
way
that
France
was
the
victim
of
attacks,"
she
said,
pointing
out
that
many
Muslim-majority
countries
have
a
permanent
travel
ban
against
Israeli
citizens.
When
asked
whether
she
would
impose
a
similar
ban
in
France,
she
avoided
answering
directly,
saying
only
that
France
had
to
be
"very
vigilant"
and
to
secure
its
borders.
"France
no
longer
has
any
borders
because
of
the
EU,"
Le
Pen
said.
'Wild
and
anarchic
globalization'
Le
Pen
said
the
flurry
of
executive
orders
signed
in
Trump's
first
days
in
office,
which
include
cutting
funds
to
aid
programs
to
erecting
a
wall
along
the
US-Mexican
border,
did
not
surprise
her.
"He
was
elected
and
he
said
that
he
was
going
to
do
this.
And
now
the
world
seems
to
be
scandalized
because
he's
implementing
what
he
promised
he
would
do
during
his
campaign,"
she
said.
Le
Pen
is
basking
in
major
geopolitical
shifts
in
the
world,
seeing
Trump's
rise
and
Britain's
vote
to
leave
the
European
Union
as
a
boon
to
her
presidential
campaign,
which
she
has
fought
on
an
anti-immigration
platform.
She
called
for
a
stop
to
the
flow
of
immigrants
coming
into
France,
but
said
she
was
not
interested
in
mirroring
Trump's
wall
to
protect
French
borders.
While
she
said
she
did
not
look
for
models
abroad,
Le
Pen
supported
Trump's
anti-free-trade
policies,
saying
that
"unfettered
free
trade
has
led
to
a
disaster."
"I
see
that
these
ideas
are
now
being
put
into
implementation
by
the
British,
following
the
referendum,
and
I
think
following
the
election
of
Donald
Trump
that
people
are
also
calling
for
an
end
to
this
wild
and
anarchic
globalization,
and
that
we
are
moving
towards
greater
patriotism,
to
the
preservation
of
culture,
of
local
jobs,"
she
said.
Frexit?
The
party
leader
repeated
a
promise
to
hold
a
referendum
on
leaving
the
European
Union
within
six
months
if
she
were
elected
president.
She
said
she
would
first
try
and
strike
a
deal
to
return
territorial,
economic
and
legal
sovereignty
to
France,
and
failing
that,
she
would
let
the
French
people
vote
on
whether
they
wanted
to
remain
in
the
regional
bloc.
On
Tuesday,
Le
Pen
locked
horns
with
the
European
Parliament,
missing
a
deadline
for
repaying
300,000
euros
that
the
Parliament
says
she
misused.
The
party
leader
denied
the
allegations
in
the
interview
and
characterized
the
issue
as
a
"political
attack."
She
said
she
would
refuse
to
pay
back
the
money.
"It's
inadmissible.
We
have
been
persecuted
by
the
EU
Parliament.
They
are
our
adversaries,"
she
said,
adding
that
she
had
filed
a
complaint
against
the
European
Anti-Fraud
Office.
Russia
sanctions
'completely
stupid'
Le
Pen,
a
long-time
supporter
of
Russian
President
Vladimir
Putin,
also
said
that
she
did
not
believe
Russia
had
"invaded"
Crimea
and
slammed
the
sanctions
slapped
on
the
country.
"These
sanctions
are
completely
stupid.
They
have
not
solved
any
problems,
they
haven't
improved
the
situation
at
all.
All
they've
done
is
create
major
economic
problems
for
the
EU,"
she
said,
adding
that
the
world
would
achieve
some
peace
with
a
"step
back
from
the
Cold
War."
