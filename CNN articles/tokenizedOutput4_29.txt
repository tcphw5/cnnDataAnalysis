(CNN)The
British
government
formally
set
out
details
for
the
first
time
Thursday
of
its
strategy
for
Britain's
departure
from
the
European
Union.CNN's
David
Wilkinson
contributed
to
this
report.The
77-page
"white
paper"
was
published
a
day
after
lawmakers
voted
overwhelmingly
in
favor
of
a
bill
that
once
finalized
would
give
May
the
authority
to
invoke
Article
50
of
the
Lisbon
Treaty
--
the
formal
process
of
leaving
the
EU.
It
contained
few
clues
about
the
government's
overall
strategy
that
were
not
evident
in
a
speech
delivered
by
Prime
Minister
Theresa
May
in
January.
But
it
fleshed
out
aspects
of
May's
plan
in
some
key
areas.
The
white
paper
said:
•
The
UK
will
seek
a
"new
strategic
partnership"
with
Europe.
While
the
UK
would
leave
the
EU
single
market
and
customs
union,
it
would
seek
to
keep
"elements"
of
the
free-trade
zone.
•
No
"cliff-edge"
Brexit.
The
government
said
it
would
seek
transitional
arrangements
to
minimize
the
impact
of
Britain's
departure
front
he
EU.
•
Early
targets
for
trade
deals
would
be
the
US,
China,
Brazil,
Australia,
New
Zealand,
India
and
states
in
the
Persian
Gulf.
It
would
seek
"continuity"
of
arrangements
with
other
countries
that
are
currently
covered
by
EU
deals.
•
The
government
hopes
for
an
"early"
agreement
on
the
status
of
the
2.8
million
EU
nationals
who
live
in
the
UK.
It
expressed
disappointment
that
a
number
of
EU
states
had
blocked
attempts
to
sort
the
issue
out
before
formal
divorce
talks
begin.
•
It
offered
no
guarantee
on
the
status
of
the
Irish
border.
The
government
said
only
that
it
would
"aim"
to
protect
the
common
travel
area
that
exists
between
Northern
Ireland,
which
is
part
of
the
UK,
and
the
Republic
of
Ireland,
which
will
remain
in
the
EU.
The
issue
is
a
key
part
of
the
deal
that
brought
peace
to
Northern
Ireland.
In
a
foreword
to
the
white
paper,
May
said
Britain
approached
the
negotiations
anticipating
success,
not
failure.
"The
House
of
Commons
has
voted
overwhelmingly
for
us
to
get
on
with
it.
And
the
overwhelming
majority
of
people
--
however
they
voted
--
want
us
to
get
on
with
it
too,"
she
said.
David
Davis,
the
Secretary
of
State
for
Exiting
the
EU,
told
the
House
of
Commons
that
Britain
wanted
the
"European
Union
to
succeed,
politically
and
economically"
and
so
would
approach
the
negotiations
in
the
"spirit
of
goodwill"
and
for
both
sides'
mutual
benefit.
Immigration:
'Nobody
will
be
thrown
out'
Around
2.8
million
EU
nationals
live
in
the
UK,
many
of
them
Polish.
Around
1
million
UK
nationals
live
in
other
member
states,
300,000
of
them
in
Spain.
Resolving
the
status
of
both
groups
was
an
"early
priority",
the
white
paper
said.
It
indicated
frustration
with
other
EU
states
that
it
had
not
already
been
dealt
with.
"The
government
would
have
liked
to
resolve
this
issue
ahead
of
formal
negotiations,"
it
said.
While
welcoming
the
contribution
of
migrants
to
Britain's
economy
and
society,
the
white
paper
said
there
had
been
"record
levels
of
long-term
net
migration
in
the
UK
and
that
sheer
volume
has
given
rise
to
public
concern."
It
cites
pressure
on
housing,
infrastructure,
public
services
and
downward
pressure
on
wages
for
those
on
the
lowest
incomes.
"We
will
design
our
immigration
system
to
ensure
that
we
are
able
to
control
the
numbers
of
people
who
come
here
from
the
EU,"
it
says.
"In
future,
therefore,
the
Free
Movement
Directive
will
no
longer
apply
and
the
migration
of
EU
nationals
will
be
subject
to
UK
law."
Pressed
in
the
House
of
Commons
by
opposition
Labour
spokesman
Keir
Starmer,
Davis
said
EU
nationals
would
not
be
forced
to
leave
the
UK.
"I
am
not
going
to
be
throwing
people
out
of
Britain
and
for
him
to
suggest
that
is
outrageous,"
he
said.
Irish
border:
'Aim'
to
keep
current
arrangements
Under
the
terms
of
the
1998
Good
Friday
Agreement,
which
brought
an
end
to
sectarian
conflict
in
Northern
Ireland,
there
is
currently
an
open
border
between
the
north
and
south.
Any
change
to
this
arrangement
would
imperil
the
peace
process,
critics
have
warned.
However,
there
are
doubts
that
the
UK
could
maintain
an
open
border
with
an
EU
member
state
--
and
the
white
paper
acknowledges
the
doubts,
saying
only
that
the
government
"aims"
to
maintain
the
current
arrangements.
Speaking
last
month,
May
said
that
finding
a
solution
to
the
border
issue
would
be
"an
important
priority,"
adding
that
"nobody
wants
to
return
to
the
borders
of
the
past,
so
we
will
make
it
a
priority
to
deliver
a
practical
solution
as
soon
as
we
can."
Trade:
'No
need
to
start
from
scratch'
The
government
will
seek
to
retain
a
large
part
of
the
country's
current
trade
arrangements
with
the
EU,
but
emphasizes
the
need
to
boost
trade
with
other
states,
citing
growth
in
its
exports
to
South
Korea,
China,
Brazil
and
Mexico.
The
paper
reiterates
May's
recent
announcement
that
Britain
will
not
remain
in
the
union's
single
market
but
will
instead
seek
"the
freest
and
most
frictionless
trade
possible
in
goods
and
services
between
the
UK
and
the
EU."
But
the
document
made
it
clear
that
the
UK
wanted
to
retain
some
parts
of
the
present
single
market
arrangements,
saying
it
"makes
no
sense
to
start
again
from
scratch"
in
areas
where
rules
have
existed
for
years.
The
government
will
seek
the
freest
possible
trade
in
financial
services,
a
key
sector
for
Britain's
economy.
Several
prominent
financial
institutions
based
in
London
have
suggested
moving
jobs
to
EU
states
to
remain
part
of
the
single
market.
From
within
the
EU,
Britain
has
been
able
to
provide
financial
services
across
the
union
under
a
common
set
of
rules
and
regulatory
authority
--
access
known
in
the
sector
as
"passporting."
More
than
5,000
UK
firms
use
passporting
to
provide
services
to
the
EU,
while
around
8,000
European
firms
use
the
instrument
to
provide
services
to
Britain,
and
UK-based
financial
institutions
have
lobbied
the
government
to
try
to
retain
passporting
rights.
The
government
hopes
to
seek
new
opportunities
and
reform
policy
in
the
agriculture,
food
and
fisheries
sectors,
which
the
paper
described
as
"currently
heavily
influenced
by
EU
laws."
Security:
'Deepen
security
cooperation'
The
government
says
it
will
continue
to
work
with
the
EU
in
fighting
terrorism
and
maintaining
security,
adding
it
is
"uniquely
placed
to
develop
and
sustain
a
mutually
beneficial
model
of
cooperation."
It
says
that
the
UK
is
"driving
or
co-driving"
approximately
half
of
the
Europol
projects
against
organized
crime,
and
cites
the
extradition
of
more
than
8,000
individuals
accused
or
convicted
of
a
criminal
offense
to
other
EU
countries
under
the
European
Arrest
Warrant.
It
reiterates
its
willingness
to
work
with
EU
allies
over
criminal
matters,
security
and
cyber
security
while
upholding
its
commitments
to
NATO.
It
also
highlights
that
it
will
"seek
a
strong
and
close
future
relationship
with
the
EU
with
focus
on
operational
and
practical
cross-border
cooperation."
Transition:
'No
cliff-edge'
The
government
says
it
wants
to
deliver
a
smooth,
orderly
exit
and
to
"avoid
a
disruptive
cliff-edge"
as
Britain
leaves
the
European
Union.
The
government
envisages
finalizing
a
deal
within
the
expected
two-year
period
after
triggering
Article
50,
but
seeks
a
phased
transition
after
that,
to
maintain
stability
and
give
businesses
and
institutions
time
to
adjust.
It
does
not
give
a
timeline
for
how
long
the
whole
process
might
take,
saying
some
elements
will
be
phased
in
faster
than
others.
But
it
stresses
Britain
will
not
seek
an
"unlimited
transitional
status"
which
would
be
good
for
neither
side.
