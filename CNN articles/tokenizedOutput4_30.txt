(CNN)A
critic
of
Russian
President
Vladimir
Putin
who
was
in
a
coma
in
2015
after
a
suspected
poisoning
has
been
hospitalized
in
Russia
after
falling
ill
in
the
early
hours
of
Thursday,
his
attorney
said.
CNN's
Steve
Almasy
and
Marilia
Brocchetto
contributed
to
this
report.
Vladimir
Kara-Murza
has
suffered
"multiple
organ
failure,"
is
on
dialysis
and
is
being
artificially
ventilated,
his
lawyer,
Vadim
Prokhorov,
wrote
on
Facebook.
Kara-Murza,
35,
is
"currently
in
a
stable
but
critical
condition"
in
a
hospital,
Prokhorov
said
by
phone.
"It
is
a
very,
very
difficult
situation,"
he
added.
Prokhorov
said
he
doesn't
believe
this
illness
is
related
to
Kara-Murza's
previous
health
problems,
but
said
he
suspects
it
is
another
case
of
poisoning.
"None
of
the
medical
staff
can
explain
the
reason
for
his
current
condition.
Both
last
time
and
once
again
now,"
he
said.
He
said
he
has
no
direct
proof
his
client
was
poisoned.
US
Sen.
Marco
Rubio,
R-Florida,
said
Putin
should
be
held
accountable
if
there
is
evidence
the
government
poisoned
Kara-Murza.
"Vladimir
Putin
does
not
deserve
any
benefit
of
the
doubt
here,
given
how
commonplace
political
assassinations
and
poisonings
have
become
under
his
regime,"
said
Rubio,
a
frequent
Putin
critic.
"I
am
praying
that
Kara-Murza's
condition
improves."
He
urged
the
White
House
and
the
State
Department
to
question
Russian
authorities
about
the
case.
Kara-Murza
is
part
of
the
Open
Russia
foundation,
an
organization
of
anti-Putin
activists
who
call
for
open
elections,
a
free
press
and
civil
rights
reforms.
Moscow
denies
involvement
in
2015
health
scare
CNN
spoke
to
Kara-Murza
in
2015,
months
after
a
mysterious
illness
nearly
killed
him.
"I
fell
into
a
coma,
all
of
my
major
organs
began
failing,
one
after
another.
It
was
the
kidneys
first,
then
the
lungs,
the
heart,
the
liver,"
he
said
at
the
time.
He
said
he
believed
his
2015
suspected
poisoning
was
a
politically
motivated
attack.
"Frankly
there
is
no
other
possible
reason,"
he
said.
"I
don't
have
any
money
dealings.
I
don't
have
any
personal
enemies.
I
didn't
steal
anybody's
wife."
The
case
had
parallels
with
the
killing
of
former
Russian
agent
Alexander
Litvinenko
in
London.
A
British
public
inquiry
into
that
2006
poisoning
found
two
former
Russian
agents
responsible
for
carrying
out
the
poisoning
with
the
radioactive
isotope
Polonium-210.
Its
final
report
concluded
that
Putin
was
"probably"
aware
of
the
operation.
The
Russian
Foreign
Ministry
dismissed
the
UK
inquiry
as
politically
motivated
and
the
Kremlin
said
Russia
wasn't
involved.
In
February
2015,
a
leading
Russian
opposition
figure
and
friend
of
Kara-Murza,
Boris
Nemtsov,
was
shot
to
death
on
a
bridge
near
the
Kremlin
as
he
walked
home
from
a
restaurant.
Kara-Murza
became
ill
four
months
later.
