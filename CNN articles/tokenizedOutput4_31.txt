(CNN)From
2012
to
2015,
the
number
of
chemical
burns
to
the
eye
linked
to
laundry
detergent
packets
rose
more
than
30
times
among
young
children,
a
new
study
says.
More
than
1,200
3-
and
4-year-olds
received
such
burns
in
that
time
period,
according
to
the
research
published
Thursday
in
the
medical
journal
JAMA
Ophthalmology.

detergent
packs,
known
as
laundry
packets
or
pods,
entered
the
mass
market
in
2012.
"Each
pod
consists
of
a
detergent
mixture
wrapped
in
a
water-soluble
film,
made
up
of
a
proprietary
polyvinyl
alcohol
polymer,"
said
Eric
J.
Moorhead,
president
and
principal
scientist
of
Good
Chemistry
LLC,
a
consulting
firm.
"The
liquid
detergent
in
the
pods
is
not
the
same
as
regular
liquid
detergent.
It
has
a
higher
concentration
of
surfactants,
chemicals
that
are
responsible
for
stain
removal,"
said
Moorhead,
who
was
not
involved
in
the
new
study.
"At
high
concentrations,
these
ordinarily
safe
ingredients
can
cause
irritation,
especially
in
sensitive
areas
like
the
eyes."
'Among
the
worst
chemicals'
Among
kids
between
3
and
4
years
old,
the
number
of
chemical
burns
in
the
eye
caused
by
laundry
detergent
packets
increased
from
12
instances
in
2012
to
480
in
2015.
Proportionally,
the
total
chemical
eye
injuries
associated
with
the
packets
increased
from
0.8%
of
all
burns
in
2012
to
26%
in
2015.
Children
can
injure
themselves
when
the
packets
break
and
the
contents
squirt
into
one
or
both
eyes,
or
when
the
contents
leak
onto
the
children's
hands
and
they
rub
their
eyes.
Most
of
these
burns
happened
in
the
home,
where
kids
are
playing
with
the
brightly
colored
packets,
"wondering
if
they're
toys,
if
they're
candy,"
said
the
lead
researcher,
Dr.
R.
Sterling
Haring
of
Johns
Hopkins
University.
They're
neither.
The
detergents
inside
the
pods
"are
among
the
worst
chemicals
that
the
eye
can
be
exposed
to,"
Haring
said:
Detergents
are
alkaline
in
nature,
and
alkaline
burns
are
typically
more
severe
than
acid
burns
in
the
eye.
"They
penetrate
deeper,
they
burn
faster,
and
they
are
more
caustic
to
the
tissues
in
the
eye
itself."
Because
the
cornea
doesn't
have
blood
vessels,
it
doesn't
heal
well,
so
if
you
scar
it
with
detergent
packet
chemicals,
"there's
a
high
risk
of
long-term
vision
impairment,"
Haring
said.
"We'd
done
another
study
a
few
months
ago
that
showed
that
small
children
are
at
highest
risk
for
all
types
of
chemical
ocular
burns,
and
that
kind
of
flew
in
the
face
of
conventional
wisdom,"
he
said.
"They
always
thought
that
working-age
men
were
the
highest
risk
group:
working
in
factories,
splashing
chemical
in
their
eyes."
Instead,
he
and
his
colleagues
were
surprised
to
find
that
young
children
have
a
50%
higher
risk
than
the
highest-risk
adult,
Haring
said.
Once
that
news
got
out,
community
physicians
insisted
that
the
cause
was
laundry
detergent
packets.
Haring
and
his
team
discovered
that
they
were
right.
Their
study
concludes
with
recommendations
that
parents
properly
store
these
packets
and
that
manufacturers
consider
new,
redesigned
packaging.
In
essence,
these
recommendations
"are
already
in
play,"
said
Brian
Sansoni,
vice
president
of
sustainability
initiatives
at
the
American
Cleaning
Institute,
which
represents
the
US
cleaning
products
industry.
He
said
the
new
study
analyzed
data
prior
to
the
new
safety
standards
that
were
published
in
December
2015
by
ASTM
International,
formerly
American
Society
for
Testing
and
Materials
International,
a
non-profit
that
develops
voluntary
consensus
standards
for
consumer
manufacturers.
The
American
Cleaning
Institute
helped
identify
proper
standards
for
the
packets.
Following
publication
of
the
safety
standards,
Procter
&
Gamble,
the
company
that
makes
Gain
and
Tide
brand
laundry
detergent
pods,
launched
ad
campaigns
to
raise
awareness
of
the
dangers
and
made
its
packaging
more
difficult
for
small
children
to
open.
Other
companies
also
followed
suit.
"Make
sure
you
keep
these
products
up
and
away
from
children
--
like
a
lot
of
household
products,"
said
Sansoni.
What
should
parents
do?
Dr.
Michael
Grosso,
chairman
of
the
department
of
pediatrics
and
chief
medical
officer
at
Northwell
Health's
Huntington
Hospital
in
Huntington,
New
York,
said
parents
need
to
worry
about
these
laundry
packets
and
keep
them
out
of
the
way.
"It's
not
only
eye
injuries.
Children
will
also
swallow
these,"
said
Grosso,
who
was
not
involved
in
the
study.
Eye
injuries
caused
by
the
packets
"can
be
quite
serious,"
he
added.
"The
majority
of
individuals
will
recover
their
vision
after
this
kind
of
injury,"
he
said.
However,
these
burns
can
be
"very,
very
painful.
They
require
extensive
emergency
treatment
and
extensive
follow-up
treatment
by
an
ophthalmologist."
The
first
thing
parents
should
do
is
"prevent
this
by
keeping
these
pods
out
of
the
way.
They
need
to
be
kept
up
high
in
cabinets
beyond
the
reach
of
a
preschool
child,
the
group
that's
most
at
risk."
If
a
child
does
get
detergent
in
their
eye,
a
parent
should
immediately
irrigate
the
child's
eyes.
"Cool
tap
water,
as
much
as
possible,
as
soon
as
possible,"
Grosso
said.
"And
then
the
very
next
step
would
be
a
trip
to
the
emergency
department."
Haring
echoed
this
advice.
"Take
your
child
and
put
their
eye
under
cool
water
under
the
faucet
and
flush
it
with
cool
water
for
20
minutes,"
he
said,
noting
that
if
the
burn
is
extremely
severe,
some
loss
of
vision
could
occur.
"Don't
stop
and
take
them
to
the
hospital.
Don't
call
and
wait
for
an
ambulance
to
show
up.
Flush
the
eye
with
cool
water
before
you
do
anything
else,"
Haring
said.
"That's
going
to
be
the
deciding
factor
about
long-term
outcome
for
this
injury."
