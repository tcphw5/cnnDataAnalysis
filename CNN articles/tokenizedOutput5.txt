(CNN)Senior
Trump
adviser
Kellyanne
Conway
made
a
statement
during
a
TV
interview
Thursday
that
pricked
the
ears
of
fact-checkers
everywhere.On

@MSNBC
I
meant
to
say
"Bowling
Green
terrorists"
as
reported
here:

grateful
no
one
seriously
hurt
in
the
Louvre
attack
...or
the
(completely
fake)
Bowling
Green
Massacre.
Please
don't
make
up
attacks.CNN's
Elizabeth
Landers
and
Tina
Burnside
contributed
to
this
reportShe
told
MSNBC's
Chris
Matthews:
"I
bet
it's
brand
new
information
to
people
that
President
Obama
had
a
six-month
ban
on
the
Iraqi
refugee
program
after
two
Iraqis
came
here
to
this
country,
were
radicalized
and
they
were
the
masterminds
behind
the
Bowling
Green
massacre.
It
didn't
get
covered."
First
of
all,
Obama
didn't
ban
the
Iraqi
refugee
program.
Second,
there's
no
such
thing
as
the
Bowling
Green
massacre.
Conway
later
clarified
that
she
was
referencing
the
case
of
two
Iraqis
--
Waad
Ramadan
Alwan
and
Mohanad
Shareef
Hammadi
--
who
lived
in
Bowling
Green,
Kentucky.
Both
were
granted
refugee
status
and
entered
the
United
States
in
2009.
"On
@hardball@NBCNews@MSNBC
I
meant
to
say
'Bowling
Green
terrorists'
as
reported
here,"
she
said,
before
linking
to
an
ABC
news
story
on
the
case.
They
were
arrested
in
May
2011
on
a
series
of
terrorism
charges
and
were
sentenced
two
years
later
after
pleading
guilty.
The
two
men
were
never
planning
on
committing
an
act
of
terrorism
on
US
soil.
Instead,
they
were
trying
to
help
get
weapons
to
al
Qaeda
in
Iraq.
They
were
terrorists
who
should
not
have
been
allowed
in
the
country,
but
they
weren't
planning
an
attack
in
the
United
States.
And
they
didn't
kill
anyone
in
Bowling
Green
(or
anywhere
else
in
the
US).
CNN
has
reached
out
to
the
White
House
seeking
comment
of
Conway's
statement
and
have
not
yet
received
a
response.
Chelsea
Clinton,
the
daughter
of
Trump's
general
election
Democratic
opponent
Hillary
Clinton,
referenced
Conway's
comments
in
a
tweet
Friday
morning,
saying
"don't
make
up
fake
attacks."
"Very
grateful
no
one
seriously
hurt
in
the
Louvre
attack
...or
the
(completely
fake)
Bowling
Green
Massacre.
Please
don't
make
up
attacks."
Some
background
on
that
case:
After
arriving
in
the
United
States,
the
men
were
monitored
by
federal
authorities.
They
told
an
FBI
confidential
informant
that
they
wanted
to
provide
weapons
and
explosives
to
al
Qaeda
in
Iraq,
court
documents
said.
An
extensive
undercover
sting
operation
was
launched,
authorities
said,
and
Alwan
--
who
a
Justice
Department
official
once
called
"a
really
bad
guy"
--
told
an
undercover
agent
he
had
been
involved
with
"hundreds"
of
IEDs.
An
indictment
released
at
the
time
said
the
United
States
was
able
to
locate
Alwan's
fingerprints
on
an
IED
and
on
the
base
of
a
cordless
phone
used
in
an
attack
near
Bayji,
Iraq
in
the
early
2000s.
That
the
vetting
process
didn't
work
and
that
these
men
were
allowed
into
the
country
highlighted
serious
flaws
in
the
refugee
resettlement
system
and
led
to
reforms
of
the
vetting
process.
As
a
result,
Obama
ordered
that
57,000-58,000
Iraqi
refugees
recently
allowed
into
the
country
be
revetted,
causing
a
massive
backlog.
So,
while
there
was
no
specific
'ban'
on
Iraqi
refugees
coming
into
the
country,
there
was
a
delay
in
allowing
anymore
in.
So
to
recap:
There
was
no
massacre
in
Bowling
Green,
and
Obama
didn't
ban
Iraqi
refugees
from
the
country
for
six
months.
Major
outlets,
including
CNN,
did
cover
Alwan
and
Hammadi's
case.
We
did
not,
however,
cover
the
Bowling
Green
massacre
because
it
never
happened.
