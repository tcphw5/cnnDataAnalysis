(CNN)Senate
Republicans
took
an
extraordinary
step
Wednesday
to
move
forward
with
two
of
President
Donald
Trump's
top
Cabinet
nominees
after
confronting
a
boycott
from
Democrats.Republican
lawmakers
on
the
Senate
Finance
Committee
--
the
panel
that
oversees
the
nominations
of
Steve
Mnuchin
to
be
Treasury
secretary
and
Rep.
Tom
Price
to
be
secretary
of
the
Department
of
Health
and
Human
Services
--
gathered
for
the
second
day
in
a
row
with
Democrats
on
the
committee
refusing
to
show
up.
The
dramatic
move
could
foreshadow
strategy
from
Republicans
over
contentious
battles
still
to
come
as
Democrats
try
to
use
a
variety
of
Senate
procedures
to
stall
the
newly
empowered
GOP.
The
most
high-profile
of
upcoming
fights
is
Trump's
Supreme
Court
pick
Neil
Gorsuch,
a
nomination
that
would
require
at
least
60
votes
to
break
a
filibuster.
Under
committee
rules,
it
is
required
that
at
least
one
Democrat
be
present
for
the
panel
to
vote
to
send
a
nominee
to
the
Senate
floor.
On
Tuesday,
not
a
single
Democrat
showed
up,
putting
the
two
nominations
at
a
standstill.
Committee
Chairman
Orrin
Hatch,
a
Utah
Republican,
pointed
to
the
"extraordinary
circumstances"
surrounding
the
gathering
and
allowed
the
Republicans
in
the
room
vote
to
suspend
the
rules
of
the
committee.
With
the
committee
rules
suspended,
the
14
Republicans
in
the
room
voted
to
move
the
Mnuchin
and
Price
nominations
to
the
full
Senate,
even
without
the
presence
of
a
single
member
of
the
opposite
party.
"They
on
their
own
accord
refused
to
participate
in
the
exercise,"
Hatch
said
about
the
Democrats
on
the
committee.
"They
have
nobody
to
blame
but
themselves."
Hatch
said
the
Senate
Parliamentarian
had
approved
of
the
procedural
maneuver,
and
insisted
to
reporters
after
the
exercise
was
a
"just
utilization"
of
the
rules.
"This
is
all
approved
by
the
Parliamentarian,"
he
said.
"I
wouldn't
have
done
it
if
it
hadn't
been."
Democrats
on
the
Finance
Committee
have
raised
serious
concerns
about
both
Price
and
Mnuchin,
arguing
that
the
two
nominees
made
misrepresentations
in
their
testimonies
before
the
Senate.
Earlier
on
Wednesday,
the
Democrats
on
the
panel
sent
a
letter
to
Hatch
requesting
that
the
two
nominees
provide
more
information
about
their
past
investments
and
actions.
The
committee's
call
for
a
9:30
a.m.
gathering
was
so
sudden
that
even
some
members
of
the
media
scrambled
to
arrive
at
the
hearing
room
in
the
Dirksen
building
on
time.
Hatch
chuckled
when
confronted
by
questions
from
reporters
about
the
little
notice
that
the
public
received
about
Wednesday
s
meeting.
"You
were
scrambling?
Well,
you
know,
that's
neither
here
nor
there,"
he
said.
The
chairman
also
said
that
he
had
not
yet
spoken
with
the
committee's
top
Democrat,
Sen.
Ron
Wyden,
Wednesday
morning.
"I
don't
feel
a
bit
sorry
for
them,"
Hatch
said.
In
a
statement,
Wyden
called
Wednesday's
development
"deeply
troubling."
"Today,
for
the
first
time
in
history,
the
Senate
Finance
Committee
broke
the
rules
to
push
through
on
a
partisan
basis
two
nominees,"
Wyden
said.
"Congressman
Tom
Price,
whose
stock
trades
call
into
question
whether
he
will
work
in
the
public
interest
or
his
own,
and
the
other,
Steven
Mnuchin,
who
appears
to
have
misled
the
committee
on
his
company's
foreclosure
practices
after
the
Great
Recession."
Democrats
asked
that
Price
offer
clarify
on
"inaccurate
and
misleading
answer
to
questions
about
privileged
and
discounted
access
to
stocks,"
and
wanted
Mnuchin
to
address
"inaccurate
and
misleading
answer
to
questions
about
the
potentially
illegal
process
known
as
robo-signing,"
among
other
things.
But
with
the
two
nominations
already
having
been
sent
to
the
full
Senate,
Republicans
are
unlikely
to
cooperate.
"I
don't
care
what
they
want
at
this
point,"
Hatch
said.
