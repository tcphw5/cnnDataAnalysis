(CNN)We're
not
even
two
weeks
into
the
Trump
presidency.
Has
your
head
exploded
yet?
If
so,
you're
right
where
Donald
Trump
and
our
shadow
ruler,
Steve
Bannon,
want
you
to
be.Get
used
to
it.
@POTUS
is
a
man
of
action
and
impact.
Promises
made,
promises
kept.
Shock
to
the
system.
And
he's
just
getting
started
https://t.co/AoUsZWClXtJoin

onslaught
of
executive
orders
and
threatening
talk,
while
entirely
in
keeping
with
what
Trump
promised
during
the
campaign,
have
left
Americans
of
many
political
leanings
feeling
overwhelmed
and
fearful
of
what
may
come
next.
The
confusion
and
chaos
generated
at
the
bureaucratic
and
individual
level
by
Trump's
most
spectacular
executive
order
--
his
ban
of
individuals
from
selected
predominantly
Muslim
countries
from
entering
the
United
States
--
came
in
part
from
its
sudden
announcement.
From
enforcers
to
the
public,
many
were
thrown
off
guard.
Welcome
to
the
shock
event,
designed
precisely
to
jar
the
political
system
and
civil
society,
causing
a
disorientation
and
disruption
among
the
public
and
the
political
class
that
aids
the
leader
in
consolidating
his
power.
Those
who
still
refuse
to
take
Trump
seriously
cite
his
incompetence
for
the
rough
start
in
office.
Yet
this
blitzkrieg
was
intentional.
"Get
used
to
it.
@POTUS
is
a
man
of
action
and
impact
...
Shock
to
the
system.
And
he's
just
getting
started"
his
counselor
Kellyanne
Conway
tweeted
Saturday.
As
Conway
implies,
these
first
days
of
the
Trump
administration
could
be
considered
a
prologue
to
a
bigger
drama,
and
one
that
reflects
the
thinking
of
Trump
and
Bannon
alike.
From
their
actions
and
pronouncements,
we
cannot
exclude
an
intention
to
carry
out
a
type
of
coup.
Many
may
raise
their
eyebrows
at
my
use
of
this
word,
which
brings
to
mind
military
juntas
in
faraway
countries
who
use
violence
and
the
element
of
surprise
to
gain
power.
Our
situation
is
different.
Trump
gained
power
legally
but
this
week
has
provided
many
indications
that
his
inner
circle
intends
to
shock
or
strike
at
the
system,
using
the
resulting
spaces
of
chaos
and
flux
to
create
a
kind
of
government
within
the
government:
one
beholden
only
to
the
chief
executive.
"Strike
at
the
enemy
at
a
time
and
place
or
in
a
manner
for
which
he
is
unprepared,"
reads
one
US
Air
Force
formulation
of
the
old
military
doctrine
of
surprise.
Trump
has
long
been
an
advocate
of
this
tactic
and
complained
various
times
during
the
campaign
that
our
armed
forces
were
far
too
transparent
about
their
planned
operations.
Yet
Bannon
is
the
mastermind
of
this
takeover
strategy
as
it's
been
adapted
to
the
domestic
realm.
Well-versed
in
military
tactics
and
the
history
of
the
radical
left
and
right,
Bannon
has
repeatedly
talked
about
"destroying
the
state"
in
the
name
of
securing
power
for
"an
insurgent,
center-right
populist
movement
that
is
virulently
anti-establishment."
Besieging
your
targets
until
nothing
makes
any
sense
--
giving
them
no
time
to
absorb
or
recover
from
attacks
--
is
a
time-tested
strategy
in
the
history
of
war
and
authoritarian
takeovers.
One
might
cite
what's
gone
on
in
Turkey
under
President
Recep
Tayyip
Erdogan.
It's
now
being
employed
at
the
pinnacle
of
American
democracy.
It's
particularly
useful
in
situations
where
the
leader
is
vulnerable
due
to
possible
investigations,
blackmails
or
other
circumstances
that
close
off
gradualist
approaches
to
implementing
an
agenda.
With
all
the
emergencies
going
on,
who
is
bothered
at
the
moment
about
those
Trump
tax
returns,
or
even
his
ties
to
Russia?
This
strategy
requires
a
two-pronged
approach.
First,
the
creation
of
a
small
group
of
loyal
insiders,
who
take
orders
directly
from
the
leader's
inner
circle
and
are
tasked
with
creating
chains
of
authority
that
bypass
those
of
the
existing
federal
government
and
party
bureaucracies.
I
was
disturbed,
but
not
surprised,
when
Conway
said
two
days
after
the
inauguration
that
"it's
really
time
for
(Trump)
to
put
in
his
own
security
and
intelligence
community."
Second
is
the
unleashing
of
the
political
purges
that
authoritarians
so
love.
Some
purges
are
punitive
(say
the
firing
of
acting
Attorney
General
Sally
Yates
because
she
defied
Trump's
immigration
order)
and
some
pre-emptive
(the
expulsion
of
senior
State
Department
staff)
but
the
effect
is
to
cleanse
the
government
of
troublemakers
and
leave
a
power
vacuum
to
be
filled
with
loyalists
--
or
not
filled
at
all,
for
added
disruption
of
the
state
bureaucracy.
Trump
campaigned
on
a
platform
of
unifying
the
nation,
but
by
striking
at
the
state
he
and
Bannon
intend
to
turn
us
against
each
other.
Their
blitzkrieg
not
only
throws
us
off
balance
but
forces
us
to
take
sides.
Do
I
work
for
Trump
or
leave
the
government?
Do
I
issue
a
statement
that
my
company
disapproves
of
the
travel
ban?
What
will
my
shareholders
and
stakeholders
think?
It's
no
accident
that
the
World
War
II
language
of
resistance
and
collaboration
has
come
back
into
circulation
--
these
are
the
situations
authoritarians
create
to
divide
us,
making
it
easier
for
them
to
restrict
our
freedoms.
Trump
and
Bannon
are
in
this
for
the
long
run.
Trump
has
already
filed
paperwork
for
a
2020
candidacy.
Our
focus,
in
the
middle
of
this
storm,
is
to
keep
our
feet
on
the
ground
and
our
eyes
on
the
prize:
the
defense
of
American
democracy.
