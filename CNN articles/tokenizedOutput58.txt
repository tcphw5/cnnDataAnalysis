(CNN)It
is
one
of
the
most
famous
stadiums
in
the
world
and
was
a
showpiece
venue
for
the
Rio
Olympics,
but
six
months
on
from
the
Summer
Games
the
iconic
Maracana
looks
more
ghostly
than
glitzy.

pic.twitter.com/ojmK6QCvhbThe
usual
bustle
of
rowdy
football
fans
is
nowhere
to
be
seen.
Daily
tours
to
the
world-renowned
landmark
have
been
suspended
and
trouble
in
the
area
has
been
on
the
rise.
Violent
robberies
and
vandalism
have
been
reported
nearby
and,
despite
the
stadium's
padlocked
gates,
a
recent
break-in
led
to
the
loss
of
expensive
equipment
and
precious
memorabilia,
including
a
bust
of
late
journalist
Mario
Filho,
whom
the
stadium
is
named
after.
A
series
of
legal
battles
and
abandonment
have
left
the
once
glorious
Maracana
in
a
state
of
total
decay
and
as
Rio
de
Janeiro
kicks
off
one
of
the
state's
main
seasonal
cups,
it
is
unclear
whether
the
stadium
will
be
able
to
host
matches
for
this,
or
any,
upcoming
tournament.
Invasion
of
worms
During
a
recent
visit,
CNN
was
able
to
see
the
extent
of
some
of
the
damage.
The
browning
pitch
has
been
invaded
by
worms,
several
windows
and
doors
have
been
broken
or
damaged
and
nearly
10%
of
the
stadium's
78,000
seats
are
missing.
"There
are
things
that
you
can
see
on
the
surface
that
are
damaged,
like
the
grass
and
the
seats,"
Daelcio
de
Freitas,
spokesperson
for
Maracana
SA,
the
firm
responsible
for
the
stadium's
upkeep,
told
CNN.
"However,
what
we
are
most
concerned
about
is
the
safety
of
the
people
who
are
coming
to
Maracana
and
we
need
to
make
sure
things,
like
the
stadium's
roof,
weren't
compromised."
The
stadium
also
had
its
power
cut
off
last
week
due
to
unpaid
bills.
So
just
months
after
hosting
the
opening
and
closing
ceremonies
at
last
summer's
Olympics
and
Paralympics,
wowing
viewers
and
spectators
with
elaborate
pyrotechnics,
this
famous
stadium
was
plunged
into
darkness.
According
to
state
energy
provider
Light,
the
stadium
had
incurred
a
debt
of
nearly
three
million
Brazilian
reals
($939,
937).

Legal
battles
Disputes
over
who
is
in
charge
of
the
stadium
involve
Maracana
SA,
the
Rio
2016
Organizing
Committee
and
the
state
of
Rio.
According
to
Maracana
SA,
the
state
and
Rio
2016
violated
the
original
contract
signed
when
the
Olympic
Committee
assumed
control
last
March.
It
claims
the
stadium
was
not
returned
in
the
conditions
stipulated
in
the
contract.
But
Rio
2016
has
said
it
was
"not
responsible"
for
the
problems
which
are
blighting
the
stadium.
Mario
Andrada,
a
spokesperson
for
Rio
2016,
recently
told
CNN
affiliate,
TV
Record:
"(We
admit)
we
need
to
make
some
repairs.
We
know
they
are
our
obligation
and
that
we
are
a
bit
behind,
but
these
things
shouldn't
keep
the
stadium
from
functioning."
Rio
2016
is
negotiating
the
payment
of
1.7
million
reals
($539.494)
--
more
than
half
of
what
is
owed
--
to
Light.
Maracana
SA
will
pay
the
remainder
of
the
debt,
charging
some
vendors
who
used
the
stadium
after
the
Olympics,
including
organizers
of
Brazil
football
great
Zico's
annual
charity
match,
the
last
match
to
be
played
there
back
in
December.
From
riches
to
rags
In
addition
to
hosting
the
2016
Olympics
and
Paralympics,
the
Maracana
was
the
venue
for
the
finals
of
the
2014
FIFA
World
Cup,
the
2013
Confederations
Cup
and
the
2007
Pan-American
Games
and
has
held
several
concerts
and
regional
football
tournaments.
Built
for
the
1950
FIFA
World
Cup,
it
hosted
the
final
between
Brazil
and
Uruguay
before
a
crowd
of
nearly
200,000,
making
it
then
the
world's
largest
stadium
by
capacity.
And
it
was
at
the
Maracana
that
Brazil's
Pele,
regarded
by
many
as
the
greatest
footballer
in
history,
became
the
first
player
to
score
1000
professional
goals.
The
stadium
was
shut
down
for
two
years
and
practically
rebuilt
for
the
2014
FIFA
World
Cup
at
a
cost
of
more
than
$500m.
But
it
is
now
unclear
what
the
landmark
stadium's
legacy
will
be.
Maracana
SA,
whose
majority
shareholder
is
construction
company
Odebrecht,
is
looking
to
hand
over
stadium
maintenance
to
interested
bidders.
According
to
Maracana
SA,
they
are
waiting
on
the
state
government
to
approve
the
move.

Rio's
Football
Federation
is
hopeful
the
final
of
Guanabara
Cup
will
be
held
in
the
stadium,
but
football
officials
are
unsure
whether
the
stadium
will
be
fully
repaired
by
then
or
who
will
be
managing
one
of
the
country's
most
beloved
venues.
Other
Olympic
venues,
like
the
Deodoro
Aquatic
Centre
and
the
Olympic
golf
course,
are
also
shut
down
and
remain
unused.
Management
of
those
venues
are
split
between
the
municipal
government
and
private
organizations.
