#tousunisTonight,
Canadians
grieve
for
those
killed
in
a
cowardly
attack
on
a
mosque
in
Quebec
City.
My
thoughts
are
with
victims
&
their
families.CNN's

CNN's
Euan
McKirdy,
Merieme
Arif,
Chuck
Johnston,
Mayra
Cuevas
and
Samira
Said
contributed
to
this
report.Alexandre
Bissonnette
was
identified
as
the
person
who
opened
fire
at
the
Quebec
Islamic
Cultural
Center,
according
to
a
source
with
the
Royal
Canadian
Mounted
Police
and
a
Quebec
City
court
clerk.
Bissonnette
faces
six
counts
of
first-degree
murder
and
five
attempted
murder
charges,
according
to
the
verified
Twitter
account
of
the
Quebec
Royal
Canadian
Mounted
Police.
He
was
a
student
at
Laval
University
in
Quebec
City,
according
to
the
school.
Goodale,
speaking
to
reporters
at
an
Ottawa
news
conference,
said
the
attack
was
one
that
would
have
been
difficult
to
prevent.
The
terror
threat
level
remains
unchanged,
he
said.
"At
this
time,
the
National
Terrorism
Threat
Level
for
Canada
remains
at
'medium,'
where
it
has
stood
since
2014,"
Goodale
said,
referring
to
the
threat
level
after
the
October
2014
incident
in
which
Michael
Zehaf
Bibeau
killed
Cpl.
Nathan
Cirilloan,
an
army
reservist,
as
he
stood
sentry
at
Canada's
war
memorial
in
Ottawa.
Witnesses
said
the
mosque
gunman
fired
indiscriminately
into
the
crowd
of
worshipers,
which
included
men,
women
and
children.
Laval
officials
said
they
"strongly
and
unreservedly
denounce
the
unacceptable
and
terrible
acts"
at
the
mosque.
Bissonnette,
who
was
a
student
in
the
university's
school
of
social
sciences,
has
been
barred
from
any
study
or
research
activities
until
the
end
of
the
current
judicial
process,
the
school
said.
Between
2002
and
2004,
Bissonnette
also
participated
in
the
Cadet
Program,
a
nationwide
youth
program
affiliated
with
the
Canadian
Armed
Forces
that
focuses
on
developing
skills
such
as
leadership
and
citizenship,
said
Maj.
Doug
Keirstead,
spokesman
for
the
Canadian
Armed
Forces.
"Cadets
are
not
members
of
the
Canadian
Armed
Forces
and
they
do
not
receive
military
training,"
Keirstead
said.
No
other
information
was
immediately
released
on
Bissonnette,
who
is
in
custody.
The
province's
premier,
Philippe
Couillard,
called
the
attack
an
act
of
terror.
Many
questions
remain,
and
some
details
have
changed
as
the
investigation
evolves.
Here's
what
we
know
so
far:
The
attack
It
was
originally
thought
two
gunmen
dressed
in
black
opened
fire
at
the
center
in
Quebec
City
on
Sunday.
Authorities
on
Monday
identified
the
six
slain
victims.
Mamadou
Tanou
Barry,
42;
Abdelkrim
Hassane,
41;
Khaled
Belkacemi,
60;
Aboubaker
Thabti,
44;
Azzeddine
Soufiane,
57;
and
Ibrahima
Barry,
39.
Five
wounded
people
remained
hospitalized
Monday,
said
a
spokeswoman
for
Hôpital
de
l'Enfant-Jésus.
The
National
Police
of
Quebec
said
39
others
inside
the
mosque
were
not
hurt.
The
investigation
Of
the
two
people
arrested
Sunday
night,
only
one
is
now
considered
a
suspect,
said
Surete
de
Quebec,
the
police
organization
investigating
the
shooting.
The
other
person
who
was
arrested
is
now
considered
a
witness
and
not
a
suspect,
as
originally
believed,
police
told
CNN.
Authorities
have
not
released
a
possible
motive,
but
police
are
investigating
the
attack
as
an
act
of
terrorism.
They're
also
trying
to
determine
if
the
shooter
had
accomplices.
CNN
partner
CBC
reported
that
an
attacker
called
911
and
said
he
was
armed,
but
said
he
was
willing
to
cooperate
with
police.
The
mosque's
response
The
mosque
urged
the
public
to
not
jump
to
conclusions
or
spread
unsubstantiated
rumors.
"Please
wait
for
preliminary
result
(of
the
investigation)
before
circulating
rumors,"
the
Quebec
Islamic
Cultural
Center
said
on
Facebook.
"The
situation
is
very
critical."
Another
post
showed
the
center's
gratitude
for
the
"hundreds
of
messages
of
compassion
coming
from
all
over."
On
Monday
night,
a
procession
of
candle-holding
marchers
spilled
quietly
into
the
snow-packed
streets
during
a
vigil
and
a
gathering
at
the
mosque.
Two
young
women
stopped
as
many
people
as
they
could
and
asked
mourners
if
they
wanted
pins
that
said
"Welcome
to
all
refugees,"
in
French
on
the
top
of
the
pin.
Milena
Babin,
a
volunteer
with
the
Intercultural
Center
of
Quebec,
handed
the
pins
out
one
by
one,
explaining
that
the
design
was
by
a
local
artist.
Babin
said
the
inscription
in
Arabic
at
the
bottom
means
welcome
to
Quebec.
"(The
buttons)
were
originally
designed
to
welcome
refugees
to
Quebec,"
Babin
said.
"But
we
had
some
leftover,
and
thought
it
was
a
good
idea
to
distribute
them
tonight."
Prime
Minister
Justin
Trudeau
was
among
the
throngs
of
people
who
attended
the
vigil.
He
carried
a
bouquet
of
flowers.
Some
people
said
they
came
to
support
the
city's
Muslim
residents.
Louis
Tardif,
15,
said
he
was
horrified
when
he
learned
his
friend's
father
was
among
the
victims.
"I
didn't
see
him
at
school
today,"
the
teenager
said.
"I
don't
know
when
I'll
see
him
again,
but
I'll
be
here
for
him
if
he
needs
me."
His
message
to
Muslims
around
the
world:
"To
stay
strong
and
to
do
what
you
want
to
do"
Mary
Christine
Miller,
31,
who
lives
nearby,
not
far
from
another
mosque,
struggled
to
understand
why
the
attack
happened.
"Why?"
she
said.
"They
didn't
do
anything
to
us,
they
were
just
praying."
Mosque
was
previously
targeted
This
is
not
the
first
time
the
mosque
has
been
targeted.
Last
year,
the
cultural
center
received
a
wrapped
pig's
head
and
a
magazine
with
a
pig
on
its
cover,
saying
"Bonne
Appetit,"
according
to
a
post
on
its
Facebook
page.
The
post
reads:
"We
just
learned
that
a
gesture
of
hate
towards
our
Great
Mosque
took
place
Sunday
morning
(14
Ramadan)
around
Salat
Al-Fajr!
Police
was
made
aware
and
opened
an
investigation!"
Under
the
Quran,
pork
is
prohibited
and
pigs
are
considered
unclean.
Quick
condemnation
Canada's
leaders
condemned
the
attack
on
social
media.
Trudeau
tweeted
his
condolences
in
both
French
and
English.
"Canadians
grieve
for
those
killed
in
a
cowardly
attack
on
a
mosque
in
Quebec
City.
My
thoughts
are
with
victims
&
their
families."
Later,
in
a
statement
on
his
official
site,
Trudeau
wrote:
"It
is
heart-wrenching
to
see
such
senseless
violence.
Diversity
is
our
strength,
and
religious
tolerance
is
a
value
that
we,
as
Canadians,
hold
dear.
"Muslim-Canadians
are
an
important
part
of
our
national
fabric,
and
these
senseless
acts
have
no
place
in
our
communities,
cities
and
country.
Canadian
law
enforcement
agencies
will
protect
the
rights
of
all
Canadians,
and
will
make
every
effort
to
apprehend
the
perpetrators
of
this
act
and
all
acts
of
intolerance."
Premier
Couillard
said
Quebec's
support
of
Muslims
will
not
waver.
"Let's
unite
against
violence,"
the
post
reads.
"We
stand
in
solidarity
with
the
Muslim
people
of
Quebec."
