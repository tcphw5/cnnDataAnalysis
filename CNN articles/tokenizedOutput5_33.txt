(CNN)President
Donald
Trump
is
quickly
becoming
the
world's
most
undiplomatic

and
unpredictable
--
diplomat.CNN's
Manu
Raju
contributed
to
this
reportOver
the
course
of
a
week,
he
had
a
bruising
telephone
call
with
the
leader
of
Australia,
one
of
America's
closet
allies.
He
complained
to
the
Mexican
President
about
that
country's
"handling"
of
"tough
hombres."
Trump
on
Friday
warned
in
a
tweet
that
Iran
was
"playing
with
fire"
with
its
ballistic
missile
tests,
part
of
an
emerging
strategy
designed
to
show
his
administration
will
take
a
much
harder
line
with
the
Islamic
Republic.
But
his
administration
stuck
to
the
tools
of
traditional
diplomacy
by
using
a
statement
from
Trump's
press
secretary
Sean
Spicer
to
warn
Israel
that
new
Israeli
settlement
activity
could
potentially
hamper
the
peace
process,
a
new
stance
for
a
White
House
that's
remained
adamant
in
its
support
for
Prime
Minister
Benjamin
Netanyahu.
Throughout
his
campaign,
Trump
hailed
the
virtues
of
being
unpredictable
on
the
world
stage.
Much
to
the
happiness
of
some
of
his
supporters,
he's
following
through.
But
in
the
process,
Trump
is
confusing
much
of
the
world.
He's
also
handing
some
leaders,
such
as
those
in
the
United
Kingdom
and
Mexico,
political
headaches
of
their
own
after
encountering
Trump.
And
some
of
America's
allies
are
beginning
to
warn
that
Trump
is
putting
over
70
years
of
transatlantic
cooperation
at
risk.
"His
style
of
diplomacy
is
very
different
from
his
recent
predecessors,"
former
Australian
Prime
Minister
Kevin
Rudd
told
CNN
International's
Hala
Gorani
Thursday.
"He
is
much
more
in
your
face.
I
suppose
the
diplomacy
of
the
rest
of
us
is
kind
of
going
to
have
to
get
used
to
that."
Michael
Fullilove,
the
executive
director
of
the
Lowy
Institute,
a
top
Australian
think-tank,
said
that
while
the
US-Australia
alliance
would
remain
strong
in
the
aftermath
of
the
tense
phone
call,
Trump's
approach
would
inevitably
have
an
impact.
"It's
a
level
of
discourtesy
that
we
don't
expect,"
he
said.
"It
will
continue
to
inform
the
Australian
public's
view
of
Mr.
Trump.
I
think
inevitably
it
would
inform
public
opinion
about
the
alliance."
Transactional
diplomacy
Trump
seems
to
view
diplomacy
through
the
prism
of
a
business
transaction,
where
there
are
winners
and
losers
and
a
belief
that
even
allies
can
take
advantage
of
the
US.
The
great
big
Rex
Tillerson
to-do
list
His
foreign
policy
thinking
--
at
least
so
far
--
appears
to
be
focusing
more
on
the
mechanics
of
individual
national
relationships
and
less
on
a
strategic
vision
in
which
allies
are
a
vehicle
for
expressing
US
power
and
influence
around
the
globe.
The
President's
phone
call
with
Australian
Prime
Minister
Malcom
Turnbull
went
off
the
rails
when
discussion
turned
to
a
deal
concluded
by
former
President
Barack
Obama
to
allow
1,250
refugees
from
an
offshore
detention
center
to
come
to
the
United
States.
Trump
tweeted
Thursday
that
the
deal
was
"dumb,"
even
though
Spicer
has
said
the
US
would
honor
the
agreement
and
despite
the
President's
order
to
temporarily
halt
all
refugees
from
entering
the
country.
The
President
was
still
fulminating
about
the
deal
by
Thursday
afternoon.
"I
just
said
why?...
Why
are
we
doing
this?
What's
the
purpose?"
Trump
told
reporters.
"We
have
wonderful
allies
and
we're
going
to
keep
it
that
way
but
we
need
to
be
treated
fairly
also."
Trump's
decision
to
question
the
deal
has
rattled
relations
with
Australia,
a
crucial
pillar
of
US
Asia-Pacific
strategy,
a
member
of
the
Five
Eyes
intelligence
sharing
agreement
and
an
ally
that
has
battled
alongside
the
United
States
dating
back
to
World
War
I.
Trump
continues
to
question
refugee
deal
after
heated
call
with
Australian
PM
Sen.
John
McCain,
who
fought
with
Australians
in
Vietnam,
took
it
upon
himself
to
smooth
over
relations
on
Thursday
following
Trump's
showdown
with
Turnbull,
telephoning
Australia's
ambassador
to
Washington.
"This
in
my
view
was
unnecessary
and
frankly,
harmful,"
the
Arizona
Republican
said,
adding
that
the
dispute
was
far
less
important
than
cooperation,
including
joint
training
missions
involving
US
Marines
in
the
northern
Australian
city
of
Darwin.
Senior
Democrats
were
also
disturbed
by
the
argument.
Virginia
Sen.
Tim
Kaine
said
to
have
a
"contentious
conversation
and
name
call
(a)
country
or
the
Prime
Minister
of
a
country
that
is
one
of
our
greatest
allies
in
Asia
is
foolish."
"He
is
doing
kind
of
amateur
hour
stuff
on
matters
of
significant
national
importance,"
said
Kaine,
who
was
the
2016
Democratic
vice
presidential
nominee.
Lesson
for
foreign
leaders
Foreign
policy
experts
said
the
US-Australia
relationship
remains
too
strong
to
be
damaged.
But
the
spat
will
be
seen
by
other
foreign
leaders
as
a
lesson
in
the
difficulty
of
dealing
with
Trump.
British
Prime
Minister
Theresa
May
found
out
that
leaders
who
align
themselves
with
Trump
can
get
burned.
The
President
didn't
tell
her
he
was
signing
an
executive
order
restricting
travel
from
seven
predominantly
Muslim
countries
soon
after
she
left
the
White
House
last
Friday,
exposing
her
to
a
torrent
of
political
criticism
back
home.
US

sanctions
on
Iran
following

test
Trump's
frequent
criticisms
of
the
European
Union,
which
he
has
branded
corrupt
while
apparently
rooting
for
more
nations
to
join
Britain
by
voting
to
leave,
is
irking
US
allies,
who
see
the
block,
for
all
its
faults,
as
the
root
of
decades
of
peace
in
Europe,
a
continent
previously
wracked
by
centuries
of
war.
"It
is
unacceptable
that
there
should
be,
through
a
number
of
statements
by
the
US
President,
pressure
on
what
Europe
should
be
or
what
it
should
no
longer
be,"
French
President
Francois
Hollande
said
at
the
EU
summit
in
Malta
on
Friday,
"There
is
no
future
with
Trump
if
it's
not
worked
together,"
Hollande
said,
according
to
an
official
Twitter
account
for
France's
representative
to
the
EU.
Trump
has
also
criticized
the
other
bulwark
of
European
security,
NATO,
as
obsolete
and
has
far
more
in
common
with
populist
leaders
seeking
to
make
an
impact
in
elections
this
year
in
the
Netherlands,
France
and
Germany
than
the
ruling
elites
in
those
nations.
Despite
anodyne
government
readouts,
there
were
also
hints
of
tension
in
Trump's
weekend
call
with
German
Chancellor
Angela
Merkel,
whom
the
President
has
criticized
for
welcoming
Syrian
refugees.
Her
office
said
Merkel
"explained"
to
Trump
that
the
Geneva
Conventions
require
nations
to
offer
a
haven
from
refugees
fleeing
war.
But
Trump
is
unapologetic
about
the
bracing
conversations
he
is
having
with
world
leaders
--
a
sign
the
White
House
is
more
concerned
about
Trump
projecting
a
strong
image
on
the
world
stage
than
stepping
on
diplomatic
toes.
"The
world
is
in
trouble,
but
we're
going
to
straighten
it
out.
OK?
That's
what
I
do.
I
fix
things.
We're
going
to
straighten
it
out,"
Trump
said
at
the
National
Prayer
Breakfast
on
Thursday.
"Believe
me.
When
you
hear
about
the
tough
phone
calls
I'm
having,
don't
worry
about
it.
Just
don't
worry
about
it.
They're
tough.
We
have
to
tough
...
We're
taken
advantage
of
by
every
nation
in
the
world
virtually.
It's
not
going
to
happen
anymore."
Trump's
pugnacious
approach
to
diplomacy
is
not
surprising
given
his
personality,
which
he
used
to
great
effect
in
his
business
career.
While
his
attitude
dismays
foreign
policy
elites,
it's
likely
to
be
welcomed
by
voters
who
turned
to
him
in
search
of
strong
leadership
and
see
his
encounters
as
a
manifestation
of
his
"America
First"
philosophy.
But
several
diplomats
have
said
Trump's
acute
course
corrections
in
foreign
policy
and
blunt
manner
make
it
difficult
to
decipher
exactly
where
the
United
States
now
stands
on
key
global
issues.
Private
vs.
public
arguments
Getting
tough
with
America's
friends
also
represents
a
break
from
previous
administrations
where
disagreements
often
erupted
but
were
not
litigated
in
public.
The
White
House
may
find
in
future
that
creating
political
problems
for
friendly
leaders
will
make
it
more
difficult
for
them
to
compromise
with
Washington
or
even
to
send
troops
to
help
fight
America's
wars.

"We
have
an
unwritten
rule
in
diplomacy,
you
are
going
to
argue
with
your
friends
but
do
it
behind
closed
doors,
don't
expose
differences,
in
public,"
Nicholas
Burns,
a
longtime
US
diplomat
and
former
under
secretary
of
state
for
political
affairs,
told
CNN
International.
"Don't
make
life
difficult
for
your
friends,
the
Prime
Minister
of
Australia,
the
Chancellor
of
Germany,
the
President
of
Mexico."
