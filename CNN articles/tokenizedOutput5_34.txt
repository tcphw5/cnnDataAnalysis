the
US
President's
call
with
Australian
Prime
Minister
Malcolm
Turnbull
on
Saturday,
Trump
objected
to
an
agreement
over
the
US
receiving
refugees,
sources
told
CNN.
All
this
a
day
after
a
call
with
Mexico's
President,
where
a
transcript
showed
Trump
complaining
about
Mexico's
"handling"
of
"tough
hombres."
Australia
is
an
ally
of
the
United
States,
with
the
two
countries
joining
three
other
English-speaking
countries
in
an
intelligence
sharing
arrangement
known
as
the
"Five
Eyes."
Refugee
deal
The
disagreement
came
as
the
two
leaders
discussed
a
deal,
reached
under
the
Obama
administration,
for
the
US
to
accept
refugees
from
Australia
who
are
living
on
islands
in
detention
centers
off
the
mainland
due
to
strict
government
policies.
Many
of
them
are
from
the
seven
countries
affected
by
Trump's
travel
ban.
Trump
on
Friday
also
suspended
the
entry
of
all
refugees
for
120
days,
along
with
indefinitely
suspending
the
entry
of
Syrian
refugees.
Sources
say
Trump
insisted
it
was
a
very
bad
deal
for
the
US
to
take
2,000
refugees
and
that
one
of
them
was
going
to
be
the
next
Boston
bomber.
Turnbull
told
Trump
several
times
the
agreement
was
for
1,250
refugees,
not
2,000.
He
also
said
Australia
was
asking
to
submit
them
to
the
US
for
refugee
screening,
and
if
the
refugees
did
not
pass
the
US
screening
process,
they
would
not
come.
Trump
expressed
concern
as
to
how
this
agreement
from
President
Barack
Obama's
administration
would
go
forward
given
his
executive
order
the
day
before
temporarily
suspending
the
US
refugee
program.
Trump
abruptly
ended
the
call
because
he
was
unhappy,
a
source
told
CNN.
White
House
press
Wednesday
night,
Trump
tweeted,
"Do
you
believe
it?
The
Obama
administration
agreed
to
take
thousands
of
illegal
immigrants
from
Australia.
Why?
I
will
study
this
dumb
deal!"
Turnbull
said
the
call
ended
"courteously"
in
a
radio
interview
Thursday.
On
Thursday,
Trump
used
his
remarks
at
the
National
Prayer
Breakfast
--
an
annual
tradition
attended
by
many
world
and
religious
leaders
--
to
weigh
in
on
the
reports
circulating
on
his
phone
calls.
"When
you
hear
about
the
tough
phone
calls
I'm
having,
don't
worry
about
it.
Just
don't
worry
about
it.
They're
tough.
We
have
to
be
tough.
It's
time
we're
going
to
be
a
little
tough,
folks,"
he
said.
"We're
taken
advantage
of
by
every
nation
in
the
world,
virtually.
It's
not
going
to
happen
anymore.
It's
not
going
to
happen
anymore."
The
Washington
Post
was
the
first
to
report
on
the
details
of
the
Australian
call.
When
asked
about
the
tweet
labeling
the
agreement
brokered
with
Obama's
administration
a
"dumb
deal,"
Turnball
said,
while
the
deal
may
not
have
been
one
Trump
would've
done
or
considered
a
"good
deal,"
the
President
and
his
administration
have
committed
to
honor
it.
Earlier
this
week,
Spicer
said
the
Trump
administration
would
honor
the
agreement,
saying
the
refugees
would
be
submitted
to
"extreme
vetting."
Turnbull
attempted
to
keep
some
semblance
of
diplomacy,
declining
to
elaborate
on
details
of
the
call.
"Look,
I'm
not
going
to
comment
on
a
conversation
between
myself
and
the
President
of
the
United
States
other
than
what
we
have
said
publicly,
and
you
can
surely
understand
the
reasons
for
that,"
he
said.
"I'm
sure
you
can
understand
that.
It's
better
these
conversations
are
conducted
candidly,
frankly,
privately.
If
you'll
see
reports
of
them,
I'm
not
going
to
add
to
them."
One
person
familiar
with
the
circumstances
on
Saturday
notes
that
President
Trump's
phone
call
with
Turnbull
came
after
a
long
day
of
conversations
with
other
foreign
leaders
--
Turnbull
was
the
fifth
call
after
conversations
with
Japanese
Prime
Minister
Abe,
French
President
Hollande,
German
Chancellor
Merkel,
and
Russian
President
Putin,
each
of
which
lasted
close
to
an
hour.
Trump,
this
source
said,
was
feeling
some
fatigue
after
his
first
major
bout
of
diplomacy.
And
while
his
earlier
conversations
weren't
necessarily
contentious,
they
did
involve
some
tense
moments.
Merkel
and
Hollande
pushed
back
on
the
travel
ban
over
the
phone.
Merkel
felt
she
had
to
explain
the
Geneva
Convention
to
Trump
--
a
lecture
a
source
has
said
Trump
chafed
at.
'Tough
hombres'
talk
with
Mexican
President
CNN
has
also
learned
details
about
the
Friday
phone
call
between
Trump
and
Pe単a
Nieto,
who
canceled
an
in-person
visit
with
Trump
after
the
US
President
insisted
Mexico
pay
for
a
border
wall
between
the
two
countries.
According
to
an
excerpt
of
the
transcript
of
the
call
with
Pe単a
Nieto
provided
to
CNN,
Trump
said,
"You
have
some
pretty
tough
hombres
in
Mexico
that
you
may
need
help
with.
We
are
willing
to
help
with
that
big-league,
but
they
have
be
knocked
out
and
you
have
not
done
a
good
job
knocking
them
out."
Trump
made
an
offer
to
help
Pe単a
Nieto
with
the
drug
cartels.
The
excerpt
of
the
transcript
obtained
by
CNN
differs
with
an
official
internal
readout
of
the
call
that
wrongly
suggested
Trump
was
contemplating
sending
troops
to
the
border
in
a
hostile
way.
The
Associated
Press
report
said
Trump
threatened
to
send
US
troops
to
stop
criminals
in
Mexico
unless
the
government
did
more
to
control
them,
but
both
the
US
and
Mexican
governments
denied
details
from
the
story.
Sources
described
the
AP's
reporting
as
being
based
upon
a
readout
--
written
by
aides
--
not
a
transcript.
Spicer
described
the
call
with
Pe単a
Nieto
as
"productive."
A
government
official
familiar
with
Trump's
interactions
with
foreign
leaders
said,
"(Trump's)
interactions
are
naive
in
that
he
keeps
suggesting
we
will
have
the
best
relationship
ever
with
a
broad
departure
of
countries,
but
there
is
no
substance
to
back
it
up.
When
he
encounters
a
policy
challenge,
like
with
Turnbull,
he
responds
with
a
tantrum."
