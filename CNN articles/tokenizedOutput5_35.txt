(CNN)For
more
than
70
years,
Australia
and
the
United
States
have
been
inseparable
allies.Do
you
believe
it?
The
Obama
Administration
agreed
to
take
thousands
of
illegal
immigrants
from
Australia.
Why?
I
will
study
this
dumb
deal!Trump
has
heated
exchange
with
Australian
PM
Military,
intelligence
and
cultural
ties,
combined
with
billions
of
dollars
in
investment
and
trade,
built
what
former
US
President
Obama
described
as
a
"great
alliance."
But
experts
say
the
fallout
from
the
rise
of
US
President
Donald
Trump,
who
had
a
heated
phone
call
with
Australian
Prime
Minister
Malcolm
Turnbull
on
the
weekend,
could
push
the
two
countries
apart.
"I
think
there
will
be
long
term
consequences,"
Australian
National
University
School
of
Politics
professor
John
Warhurst
told
CNN.
"It
may
well
be
that
Trump's
US
and
the
rest
of
the
world
is
fundamentally
changed
over
the
coming
years."
In
a
phone
call
on
Saturday,
Trump
and
Turnbull
butted
heads
about
a
deal
struck
with
the
Obama
administration
for
the
United
States
to
take
1,250
refugees
from
Australia's
offshore
detention
centers.
"I
hope
that
friends
on
both
sides
can
limit
the
damage
that
Mr
Trump
has
done
today
...
It's
a
very
troubling
start
to
Mr
Trump's
management
of
the
Australia
alliance,"
Executive
Director
of
Sydney's
Lowy
Institute,
Dr
Michael
Fullilove,
told
CNN.
'Australia
looks
to
America'
The
US-Australian
alliance
dates
back
to
the
height
of
World
War
II,
when
Australian
Prime
Minister
John
Curtin
announced
a
major
shift
in
foreign
policy.
"Australia
looks
to
America,
free
of
any
pangs
as
to
our
traditional
links
or
kinship
with
the
United
Kingdom,"
he
wrote
in
his
New
Year
message
published
on
December
27,
1941.
Since
then
Australia
has
fought
in
at
least
five
wars
with
the
United
States,
including
Vietnam,
Afghanistan
and
Iraq.
US
troops
are
stationed
at
a
military
base
in
the
northern
Australian
city
of
Darwin,
as
part
of
a
deal
struck
by
Obama.
More
than
70
years
after
Curtin's
message,
speaking
to
the
US
congress
in
2012,
Prime
Minister
Julia
Gillard
reduced
Speaker
John
Boehner
to
tears
as
she
told
them,
"Americans
can
do
anything."
The
two
even
share
confidential
information
as
part
of
the
exclusive
intelligence
sharing
arrangement
known
as
"Five
Eyes,"
along
with
Canada,
New
Zealand
and
the
United
Kingdom.
"It's
a
cultural
alliance,
it's
certainly
a
military
alliance
and
in
that
sense
it's
Australia's
closest
alliance.
I
don't
think
any
other
countries
match
the
closeness
of
that
relationship,"
Warhurst
said.
Tens
of
billions
of
dollars
of
trade
flows
between
the
countries
every
year,
making
the
US
Australia's
second-largest
trading
partner
in
2015.
Frayed
alliance
Even
before
Trump's
rise
to
power,
there
had
been
complaints
in
Australia
about
the
closeness
of
the
US
alliance.
"For
generations
of
(Australian)
politicians
it's
been
the
default
option
--
the
alliance
is
vital,"
International
Politics
professor
Mark
Beeson
at
University
of
Western
Australia
told
CNN.
"However
there
have
been
the
beginnings
of
the
debate
in
Australia
about
what
the
benefit
of
the
alliance
was
...
What
is
Australia's
vital
strategic
interest
in
Iraq
and
Afghanistan?"
Beeson
said
Trump
could
push
Australia
towards
closer
alliances
with
its
allies
in
the
Asia
region,
including
South
Korea,
Japan
and
Indonesia.
"(The
change)
wouldn't
leave
Australia
as
vulnerable
to
shifts
in
US
foreign
policy
and
leadership,"
he
said.
But
Fullilove
said
it
was
far
too
soon
to
tell
what
the
final
fallout
would
be
to
the
Australia-US
alliance,
saying
the
relationship
was
larger
than
just
Trump
and
Turnbull.
"(With
Trump)
if
you
overreact
to
every
tweet
you
will
exhaust
yourself,"
he
said.
"You're
better
to
squint
your
eyes
and
think
what
is
the
lasting
damage
and
we
don't
know
the
damage
yet."
