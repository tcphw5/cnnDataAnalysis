(CNN)What
do
you
do
if
you
find
a
snake
in
your
toilet?
If
you're
Isac
Mcfadden,
you
go
get
your
mom.The
young
boy
from
Abilene,
Texas,
woke
up
Tuesday
morning
and
headed
to
the
bathroom.
To
his
surprise,
he
found
a
rattlesnake
slithering
up
his
toilet
bowl,
KXVA
reports.
"I
found
this
big
clump,
and
I
knew
it
was
a
snake,"
said
Isac.
He
quickly
called
his
mom,
Cassie
Mcfadden,
who
recruited
one
of
Isac's
older
brothers
to
get
a
shovel
to
kill
the
snake.
"I
was
just
like,
what
do
you
do
with
this?
What
do
you
do
with
this?
I
don't
know!"
Cassie
told
the
station.
Cassie
Mcfadden
killed
the
snake
while
dad,
Jason,
called
Big
Country
Snake
Removal.
When
the
technician
arrived,
he
found
24
Western
diamondback
rattlesnakes
--
13
in
the
cellar,
five
adults
and
five
babies
underneath
the
house,
and
the
one
snake
in
the
toilet,
which
had
entered
through
a
relief
pipe.
"Rattlesnakes
are
secretive
and
can
be
very
cryptic
--
They
rely
heavily
on
their
camouflage,"
the
company
warned
on
its
Facebook
page.
"This
is
simply
how
they
survive.
Just
because
you
don't
see
them
doesn't
mean
they
aren't
there."
The
firm
recommended
that
property
owners
have
their
homes
checked
regularly
for
snake
infestations
and
said
they
shouldn't
be
afraid.
"Rattlesnakes
are
an
absolute
necessity
for
the
ecosystems,
and
people
have
an
irrational
fear
about
them,"
a
company
spokesman
said.
Isac
and
his
brothers
had
some
final
words
of
wisdom
for
other
kids
who
encounter
snakes
in
their
homes.
"If
you
find
a
snake,"
they
told
KXVA,
"always
get
an
adult."
