(CNN)President
Donald
Trump
veered
off
script
at
the
start
of
the
National
Prayer
Breakfast
Thursday
when
he
asked
a
room
full
of
lawmakers,
foreign
dignitaries
and
religious
leaders
to
pray
for
Arnold
Schwarzenegger
so
that
ratings
of
his
show
--
NBC's
"The
Apprentice"
--
would
go
up.The
National
Prayer
Breakfast?

who
lauded
the
six-decade
long
traditional
gathering
as
a
"testament
to
the
power
of
faith"
was
introduced
by
Mark
Burnett,
the
television
producer
who
teamed
up
with
Trump
to
create
"The
Apprentice."
The
hit
show
arguably
launched
Trump's
political
ambitions.
Trump
left
the
show,
however,
in
2015
as
he
explored
a
presidential
run
and
Burnett
replaced
him
with
Schwarzenegger,
the
movie
star
and
former
California
governor.
Trump
trashes
Arnold
Schwarzenegger
for
'Apprentice'
ratings
"We
know
how
that
turned
out,"
Trump
said,
knocking
Schwarzenegger.
"The
ratings
went
right
down
the
tubes.
It
has
been
a
disaster."
Trump
then
turned
to
the
audience
and
said:
"I
want
to
just
pray
for
Arnold
...
for
those
ratings."
The
comment
may
have
been
intended
as
a
joke,
but
Trump's
opening
came
in
sharp
contrast
to
how
past
presidents
have
addressed
the
breakfast.
Schwarzenegger
promptly
replied
via
a
Twitter
video:
"Hey
Donald.
I
have
a
great
idea.
Why
don't
we
switch
jobs?
You
take
over
TV,
cause
you're
such
an
expert
in
ratings.
And
I
take
over
your
job,
so
that
people
can
finally
sleep
comfortably
again."
Trump
and
Schwarzenegger
have
been
in
a
public
back-and-forth
since
the
former
California
governor
took
over
the
show.
Trump
is
still
listed
as
an
executive
producer
on
the
current
season,
and
the
assets
he
put
in
a
trust
managed
by
his
sons
still
includes
a
financial
stake
in
the
reality
show.
The
annual
multi-faith
breakfast
is
held
on
the
first
Thursday
of
February
each
year.
Lawmakers
and
religious
leaders
from
about
70
countries
gather
at
the
Washington
event,
first
organized
in
1953.
It
is
meant
to
bring
bipartisan
political
leaders
and
their
religious
counterparts
together
to
meet,
pray
and
build
relationships.
Every
president
since
Dwight
D.
Eisenhower
has
headlined
the
event.
Trump
used
his
remarks
to
weigh
in
on
reports
circulating
on
his
phone
calls
with
foreign
leaders
from
Australia
and
Mexico,
attempting
to
allay
concerns.
"When
you
hear
about
the
tough
phone
calls
I'm
having,
don't
worry
about
it.
Just
don't
worry
about
it.
They're
tough.
We
have
to
be
tough.
It's
time
we're
going
to
be
a
little
tough,
folks,"
he
said.
"We're
taken
advantage
of
by
every
nation
in
the
world,
virtually.
It's
not
going
to
happen
anymore.
It's
not
going
to
happen
anymore."
The
keynote
speaker
at
the
National
Prayer
Breakfast
was
Barry
Black,
the
chaplain
of
the
United
States
Senate.
Moved
by
Black's
remarks,
Trump
lauded
him.
"Thank
you
as
well
to
senator
chaplain
Barry
Black
for
his
moving
words,"
he
said.
Trump
added:
"I
don't
know,
chaplain,
whether
that's
an
appointed
position?
Is
that
an
appointed
position?
I
don't
know
if
you're
Democrat
or
Republican,
but
I'm
appointing
you
for
another
year.
The
hell
with
it."
To
many,
especially
the
religious
leaders
in
the
room,
"hell"
is
a
swear
word.
'Celebrity
Apprentice'
ratings
get
no
Trump
bump
When
then-President
Barack
Obama
spoke
at
the
national
prayer
event
in
2016,
he
highlighted
the
importance
of
needing
to
overcome
fear
through
faith.
Trump
also
touched
on
supporting
religious
liberty,
protecting
national
security
and
defending
his
controversial
travel
ban
in
his
wide-ranging
speech.
"Our
republic
was
formed
on
the
basis
that
freedom
is
not
a
gift
from
government,
but
freedom
is
a
gift
from
God.
It
was
the
great
Thomas
Jefferson
who
said,
'The
god
who
gave
us
life,
gave
us
liberty,'
"
Trump
said.
He
continued:
"Jefferson
asked,
'Can
the
liberties
of
a
nation
be
secured
when
we
have
removed
a
conviction
that
these
liberties
are
the
gift
of
god?'
Among
those
freedoms
is
the
right
to
worship
according
to
our
own
beliefs.
That
is
why
I
will
get
rid
of
and
totally
destroy
the
Johnson
amendment
and
allow
our
representatives
of
faith
to
speak
freely
and
without
fear
of
retribution.
I
will
do
that."
The
Johnson
amendment
prohibits
tax-exempt
organizations
like
religious
groups
from
endorsing
or
opposing
political
candidates,
something
Trump
often
mentioned
on
the
campaign
trail.
In
2013,
neurosurgeon
Ben
Carson
rose
to
political
prominence
after
giving
an
impassioned
speech
at
the
breakfast.
Carson,
Trump's
nominee
to
lead
the
Department
of
Housing
and
Urban
Development,
attacked
what
he
saw
as
government
overreach
including
in
the
area
of
health
care,
one
of
Obama's
signature
policy
achievements.
His
performance
made
him
a
favorite
of
conservatives,
in
no
small
part
because
his
full-throated
denouncement
came
with
Obama
sitting
near
him
at
the
head
table.
Obama's
final
speech
focused
on
overcoming
fear
through
faith.
The
2016
breakfast
came
one
day
after
Obama
made
a
historic
visit
to
a
Baltimore
mosque
and
spoke
about
the
importance
of
religious
inclusivity.
"Fear
can
lead
us
to
lash
out
against
those
who
are
different
or
lead
us
to
try
to
get
some
sinister
'other'
under
control,"
said
Obama,
making
a
veiled
reference
to
divisive
rhetoric
on
the
presidential
campaign
trail.
This
is
Trump's
first
time
attending
the
breakfast.
