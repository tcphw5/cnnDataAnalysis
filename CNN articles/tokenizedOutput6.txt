(CNN)President
Donald
Trump's
plan
to
build
a
wall
on
the
border
with
Mexico
is
facing
a
major
problem:
A
wall
of
resistance
from
his
own
party.
CNN's
Tom
LoBianco
contributed
to
this
report.A
growing
number
of
congressional
Republicans
are
objecting
to
the
cost
and
viability
of
a
proposal
that
was
a
rallying
cry
for
the
billionaire
businessman
during
his
insurgent
campaign.
Interviews
with
more
than
a
dozen
GOP
lawmakers
across
the
ideological
spectrum
suggest
Trump
could
have
a
difficult
time
getting
funding
for
his
plan
approved
by
Congress.
Many
bluntly
told
CNN
they'd
likely
vote
against
any
Trump
plan
that
is
not
fully
offset
with
spending
cuts,
while
others
questioned
whether
Trump's
vision
would
adequately
resolve
the
problems
at
the
border.
"If
you're
going
to
spend
that
kind
of
money,
you're
going
to
have
to
show
me
where
you're
going
to
get
that
money,"
said
Alaska
Sen.
Lisa
Murkowski,
a
key
swing
vote
who
has
already
broken
with
Trump
over
his
nominee
for
secretary
of
education.
"I
don't
see
how
you
can
get
a
bill
like
that
through
(Congress)
without
offsets,"
she
added.
"I
don't
see
how
that's
possible."
Trump's
wall
already
faces
legal
hurdles
given
the
likelihood
that
it
could
spawn
lawsuits
at
the
border.
But
if
Congress
doesn't
go
along
with
his
funding
plan,
it
could
effectively
stall
Trump's
proposal
right
out
of
the
gate.
House
Speaker
Paul
Ryan
and
Senate
Majority
Leader
Mitch
McConnell
said
last
week
that
the
cost
could
range
from
$12
billion-$15
billion,
while
Ryan
suggested
that
the
project
may
not
be
fully
offset
with
spending
cuts,
saying
the
wall
is
"a
national
security
priority."
Sen.
John
Cornyn,
the
No.
2
Senate
Republican
who
represents
the
border
state
of
Texas,
was
deeply
skeptical
about
whether
a
wall
alone
would
be
enough
to
deter
immigrants
from
entering
the
country
illegally.
And
he
issued
a
stark
warning
to
Trump.
"I
have
concerns
about
spending
un-offset
money,
which
adds
to
the
debt,
period,"
Cornyn
said
bluntly
when
asked
about
the
wall.
"I
don't
think
we're
just
going
to
be
able
to
solve
border
security
with
a
physical
barrier
because
people
can
come
under,
around
it
and
through
it."
Trump
has
increasingly
said
that
Congress
would
fund
the
wall
initially
but
would
later
be
reimbursed
completely
by
Mexico.
But
prominent
Republicans
say
flatly
that
they
don't
think
Mexico
will
pay
the
United
States
back
--
and
Mexican
leadership
has
repeatedly
said
the
same
--
meaning
that
taxpayers
would
be
left
holding
the
bag.
"No,"
Arizona
Republican
Sen.
John
McCain
said
when
asked
if
he
thought
Mexico
would
reimburse
the
United
States
for
the
wall.
"It's
not
a
viable
option."
McCain
added:
"If
you
only
build
a
wall,
only
a
'wall,'
without
using
technology,
individuals,
drones,
observations,
etc.,
you're
not
going
to
secure
the
border."
Trump
still
has
time
to
convince
his
party
to
go
along,
especially
if
he
provides
more
details
on
his
plans,
given
Republicans
are
largely
united
behind
calls
for
more
robust
border
security.
And
some
GOP
senators,
like
Ron
Johnson
of
Wisconsin,
suggest
they're
open
to
paying
for
the
wall
even
if
it's
not
offset
by
spending
cuts.
White
House
lobbying
Behind
the
scenes,
the
Trump
administration
has
tried
to
shore
up
support.
John
Kelly,
the
new
secretary
of
Homeland
Security,
began
to
discuss
with
lawmakers
this
week
his
border
security
plans,
sources
said,
but
senators
reported
there
were
few
details
on
the
specifications
of
the
wall.
The
Trump
administration
is
working
on
a
supplemental
funding
package
to
pay
for
border
and
national
security,
but
that
work
has
stalled
as
the
Senate
moves
slowly
to
confirm
Trump's
pick
of
Rep.
Mick
Mulvaney
as
his
budget
director.
Still,
Trump
wants
to
move
quickly
on
the
wall,
within
the
first
quarter
of
this
year.
And
even
if
he
asks
for
spending
cuts
to
pay
the
wall,
sources
on
the
House
and
Senate
appropriations
committees
say
finding
upwards
of
$15
billion
in
reductions
would
be
extraordinarily
difficult,
especially
in
the
middle
of
the
fiscal
year.
After
last
week's
party
retreat
in
Philadelphia,
many
Republicans
also
voiced
concerns
that
there
isn't
enough
focus
on
reducing
the
debt
and
deficit
--
especially
as
Trump
pushes
Congress
to
green-light
new
infrastructure
projects
aside
from
the
wall.
"I
don't
want
to
see
any
spending,
additional
spending
on
anything
done
that
is
not
paid
for,"
said
Sen.
Bob
Corker,
Republican
of
Tennessee,
when
asked
about
the
wall.
"We
have
got
a
huge
fiscal
problem
right
now
--
$20.355
trillion
in
debt
projected
to
add
$9.7
trillion
over
the
next
10
years.
And
I'm
concerned
that
when
I
left
the
retreat
last
week
there
are
so
many
things
that
people
are
talking
about
spending
money
on
and
at
the
same
time
lowering
the
amount
of
revenue.
And
it's
a
recipe
for
disaster."
Corker
added
he
was
concerned
about
a
number
of
proposals
that
will
add
to
the
debt
--
not
just
the
wall.
A
White
House
spokesperson
did
not
respond
to
a
request
for
comment,
but
the
administration
has
been
vague
on
its
plans.
White
House
spokesman
Sean
Spicer
suggested
last
week
that
the
administration
was
considering
imposing
a
20%
tax
on
Mexican
imports
to
pay
for
the
wall,
but
hours
later
said
it
was
one
of
a
list
of
ideas
after
Republican
senators
pushed
back
on
that
proposal.
In
one
of
his
first
moves
as
president,
Trump
took
executive
action
to
order
the
construction
of
the
wall,
with
Spicer
saying
"his
goal
was
to
get
the
project
started
as
quickly
as
possible"
with
existing
funds
and
then
"move
forward
and
work
with
Congress
on
an
appropriation
schedule."
Spicer
added
that
the
American
taxpayer
will
be
"wholly
respected."
But
lawmakers
will
need
more
convincing
to
agree
to
pay
up.
Sen.
James
Lankford
of
Oklahoma
is
skeptical
that
Trump
will
get
Mexico
to
pay
for
the
wall,
meaning
he
thinks
Congress
needs
to
find
spending
cuts
to
pay
for
the
plan.
"I
don't
count
on
Mexico
to
pay
for
our
national
security,"
Lankford
said.
"It's
the
responsibility
of
every
nation
to
take
care
of
their
own
security."
Sen.
Lamar
Alexander
of
Tennessee,
a
close
McConnell
ally
who
sits
on
the
Senate
Appropriations
Committee,
said:
"Everything
we
spend
we
need
to
find
a
way
to
pay
for."
In
the
House,
Trump
could
also
face
a
wall
of
resistance
from
deficit
hawks
like
Rep.
Justin
Amash
of
Michigan.
"It
looks
like
they're
going
to
blow
up
our
budget,"
Amash
warned.
