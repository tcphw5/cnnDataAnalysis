(CNN)President
Donald
Trump
fired
acting
Attorney
General
Sally
Yates
Monday
night
for
"refusing
to
enforce
a
legal
order
designed
to
protect
the
citizens
of
the
United
States,"
the
White
House
said.
The
Democrats
are
delaying
my
cabinet
picks
for
purely
political
reasons.
They
have
nothing
going
but
to
obstruct.
Now
have
an
Obama
A.G.CNN's
Kevin
Liptak,
Theodore
Schleifer
and
Pamela
Brown
contributed
to
this
report."(Yates)
has
betrayed
the
Department
of
Justice,"
the
White
House
statement
said.
Dana
Boente,
US
attorney
for
the
Eastern
District
of
Virginia,
was
sworn
in
at
9
p.m.
ET,
per
an
administration
official.
A
few
hours
later,
Boente
issued
a
statement
rescinding
Yates'
order,
instructing
DOJ
lawyers
to
"defend
the
lawful
orders
of
our
President."
Trump
didn't
call
Yates
to
dismiss
her,
she
was
informed
by
hand-delivered
letter,
according
to
a
different
administration
official.
The
dramatic
move
came
soon
after
CNN
reported
Yates
told
Justice
Department
lawyers
not
to
make
legal
arguments
defending
Trump's
executive
order
on
immigration
and
refugees.

White
House
statement
The
move
set
up
a
clash
between
the
White
House
and
Yates,
who
was
appointed
by
President
Barack
Obama
and
was
set
to
serve
until
Sen.
Jeff
Sessions,
Trump's
nominee
for
attorney
general,
if
confirmed.
"My
responsibility
is
to
ensure
that
the
position
of
the
Department
of
Justice
is
not
only
legally
defensible,
but
is
informed
by
our
best
view
of
what
the
law
is
after
consideration
of
all
the
facts,"
she
said
in
a
letter.
"In
addition,
I
am
responsible
for
ensuring
that
the
positions
we
take
in
court
remain
consistent
with
this
institution's
solemn
obligation
to
always
seek
justice
and
stand
for
what
is
right."
Trump's
executive
order,
signed
Friday,
bars
citizens
of
seven
Muslim-majority
countries
from
entering
the
United
States
for
the
next
90
days,
suspends
the
admission
of
all
refugees
for
120
days
and
indefinitely
suspends
the
Syrian
refugee
program.
Yates'
decision
came
amid
a
flood
of
protests
against
the
executive
order
nationwide
and
after
four
federal
judges
ruled
against
Trump's
order,
staying
its
impact
on
people
who
were
detained
at
US
airports
over
the
weekend.
Trump
tweeted
his
response
shortly
after
the
news
broke,
saying
Democrats
have
stymied
Sessions'
confirmation,
enabling
Yates.
"The
Democrats
are
delaying
my
cabinet
picks
for
purely
political
reasons.
They
have
nothing
going
but
to
obstruct.
Now
have
an
Obama
A.G.,"
he
said.
"At
present,
I
am
not
convinced
that
the
defense
of
the
executive
order
is
consistent
with
these
responsibilities
nor
am
I
convinced
that
the
executive
order
is
lawful,"
Yates
wrote.
Yates'
decision
was
always
likely
to
be
extremely
short-lived
as
Sessions
is
scheduled
for
a
vote
in
the
Senate
Judiciary
Committee
on
Tuesday.
White
House
policy
director
Stephen
Miller,
who
helped
craft
the
executive
order,
called
Yates'
decision
"a
further
demonstration
of
how
politicized
our
legal
system
has
become."
The
US
ban:
Why
these
7?
"It's
sad
that
our
politics
have
become
so
politicized,
that
you
have
people
refusing
to
enforce
our
laws,"
Miller
said
Monday
night
on
MSNBC.
Miller
also
defended
the
executive
order's
legality,
insisting
that
the
Immigration
and
Nationality
Act
gives
the
President
"the
ability
to
exclude
any
class
of
would-be
visitors
or
immigrants
to
our
country
based
on
our
national
security
interests."
But
the
decision
didn't
face
the
same
criticism
from
Rep.
Pete
Sessions,
a
top
House
Republican,
who
said
Yates'
decision
was
likely
similar
"to
an
evaluation
that
we
made."
"And
that
was
it
did
not
appear
to
be
specific
in
nature,"
Sessions
said
referring
to
the
executive
order.
"So
it
may
be
a
matter
of
clarity
it
may
be
a
matter
of
illegality
to
him,
it
may
be
a
matter
of
several
things.
It
did
not
look
as
complete
and
succinct
as
what
I
think
I
would've
wanted."
Rep.
Elijah
Cummings,
the
top
Democrat
on
the
House
Oversight
Committee,
praised
Yates
for
standing
up
"on
principle."
"In
all
my
years
as
a
member
of
Congress,
which
now
is
21,
I've
met
so
many
very
principled
people
who
truly
believe
in
the
Constitution
and
doing
what
is
right,"
Cummings
said.
"There
comes
a
time
when
people,
no
matter
who
may
be
their
boss,
they
stand
upon
their
principles,
so
at
the
end
of
the
day
they
can
look
them
selves
in
the
mirror
and
say
'I
synchronized
my
conduct
with
my
conscience.'
And
Yates
is
such
a
person."
Currently,
there
are
cases
filed
in
at
least
five
states
including
Virginia,
New
York,
Massachusetts,
Washington
and
California
that
are
challenging
Trump's
order.
The
decision
effectively
grounds
the
executive
order
for
the
next
few
days
until
Sessions
is
sworn
in.
"This
will
be
moot.
Then
we
will
very
much
see
the
Trump
Justice
Department
led
by
Jeff
Sessions
defend
this
executive
order
pretty
vigorously.
And
then
it
will
be
up
to
the
courts,"
said
Steve
Vladeck,
a
CNN
contributor
and
law
professor
at
the
University
of
Texas
School
of
Law.
In
a
written
statement,
Obama
Attorney
General
Loretta
Lynch
lauded
Yates,
calling
her
leadership
"courageous."
"(Yates)
displayed
the
fierce
intellect,
unshakeable
integrity,
and
deep
commitment
to
the
rule
of
law,"
Lynch
said.
Senate
Minority
Leader
Chuck
Schumer
told
CNN's
Erin
Burnett
Monday
the
Justice
Department
decision
reflects
poorly
on
the
Trump
administration.
"When
you
do
something
as
important
as
this,
it
can't
be
a
Twitter-type
of
activity,"
Schumer
said.
"This
has
to
be
thoroughly
vetted
...
and
it's
a
very
bad
omen
for
this
presidency."
Activists
who
have
led
the
fight
against
Trump's
immigration
ban
lauded
Yates'
action
Monday
night.
"We
took
to
the
court
room,
people
took
to
the
streets
and
now
principled
federal
officials
are
drawing
a
hardline
on
this
shameful
and
unconstitutional
act
by
President
Trump.
This
is
what
we
rely
on
the
Department
of
Justice
for,
to
uphold
the
rule
of
law
no
matter
how
the
political
wind
is
blowing,"
said
Karen
Tumlin,
the
National
Immigration
Law
Center's
legal
director.
Lee
Gelernt,
the
American
Civil
Liberties
Union
lawyer
who
argued
against
the
immigration
ban
in
court
in
New
York,
praised
Yates'
decision
and
called
on
the
next
attorney
general
to
"continue
with
that
policy."
"This
ban
will
do
irreparable
damage
to
real
people
and
to
American
values,"
he
said.
