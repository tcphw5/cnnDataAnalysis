(CNN)The
Boy
Scouts
of
America
says
it
will
begin
accepting
members
based
on
their
gender
identity,
opening
the
door
for
transgender
boys
to
join.CNN's
Jamiel
Lynch
contributed
to
this
report.Under
the
new
policy,
which
takes
effect
immediately,
membership
in
Cub
Scouts
and
Boy
Scouts
will
be
based
on
the
gender
indicated
on
an
application.
Previously,
the
organization
relied
on
an
individual's
birth
certificate
to
determine
eligibility
for
its
single-gender
programs.
"However,
that
approach
is
no
longer
sufficient
as
communities
and
state
laws
are
interpreting
gender
identity
differently,
and
these
laws
vary
widely
from
state
to
state,"
BSA
spokeswoman
Effie
Delimarkos
said
in
a
statement
Monday.
The
change
brings
the
Boy
Scouts
in
line
with
other
youth
organizations,
including
the
Girl
Scouts,
that
have
created
transgender-friendly
membership
policies
in
recent
years.
It
comes
a
few
months
after
an
8-year-old
Cub
Scout
in
New
Jersey
accused
the
organization
of
expelling
him
for
being
transgender.
The
Boy
Scouts
did
not
specifically
cite
the
New
Jersey
case
in
its
statement.
But
Chief
Scout
Executive
Michael
Surbaugh
acknowledged
the
group
recently
had
been
"challenged
by
a
very
complex
topic...
the
issue
of
gender
identity."
"We've
taken
the
opportunity
to
evaluate
and
update
our
approach.
I
hope
you'll
join
with
me
in
embracing
the
opportunity
to
bring
scouting
to
more
families
and
children
who
can
benefit
from
what
our
organization
has
to
offer,"
he
said
in
video
statement.
"This
is
an
area
that
we
will
continue
to
thoughtfully
evaluate
to
bring
the
benefits
of
scouting
to
the
greatest
number
of
youth
possible
all
while
remaining
true
to
our
core
beliefs."
Zach
Wahls,
co-founder
of
Scouts
for
Equality,
applauded
the
decision
and
credited
the
New
Jersey
case
with
forcing
BSA
to
rethink
its
policy.
"This
is
another
historic
day
for
the
Boy
Scouts
of
America.
The
decision
to
allow
transgender
boys
to
participate
in
the
Cub
Scouts
and
the
Boy
Scouts
is
an
important
step
forward
for
this
American
institution,"
Wahls
said.
"We
are
incredibly
proud
of
Joe
Maldonado
--
the
transgender
boy
from
New
Jersey
whose
expulsion
last
year
ignited
this
controversy
--
and
his
mother
Kristie
for
their
courage
in
doing
what
they
knew
was
right.
We
are
also
proud
of
the
Boy
Scouts
for
deciding
to
do
the
right
thing.
We
look
forward
to
seeing
more
detail
clarifying
this
policy
change
in
the
days
and
weeks
ahead."
The
Boys
Scouts
of
America
has
come
under
fire
in
the
past
over
LGBT
issues.
In
2015,
it
lifted
the
ban
on
gay
adults
as
Scout
leaders.
And
it
was
only
three
years
ago
that
it
allowed
allowed
openly
gay
youths
to
join
scouting.
