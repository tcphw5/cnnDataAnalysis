was
no

to
lawsuits,
both
frivolous
and
substantive.

The
high-profile
wheeler
and
dealer
filed
numerous
lawsuits
and
faced
an
array
of
allegations
of
his
own
before
stepping
into
the
Oval
Office,
including
claims
of
sexual
harassment,
bilking
investors
and
defrauding
students
of
his
eponymous
university.
Donald
Trump
the
president
has
continued
that
legal
legacy,
as
it
were.
In
his
first
11
days
at
the
country's
helm,
his
travel
ban
and
perceived
conflicts
of
interest
have
spawned
a
handful
of
lawsuits,
with
plaintiffs
contending
the
President
of
the
United
States
should
not
be
barring
certain
immigrants
from
entering
the
country
and
that
his
enterprises
around
the
globe
should
not
be
accepting
business
from
foreign
governments.
Trump
and
his
representatives
have
repeatedly
defended
the
travel
ban
and
dismissed
concerns
about
potential
conflicts
of
interest.
Earlier
this
month
Trump
said
he
would
transfer
his
business
holdings
to
a
trust
run
by
his
sons.
As
of
midday
Tuesday,
Trump
has
been
named
in
42
federal
lawsuits
since
his
inauguration.
By
comparison,
former
President
Barack
Obama
was
named
in
11
suits
during
his
first
11
days
in
office
--
some
of
them
involving
the
long-debunked
"birther"
claims
that
Obama
was
not
an
American
citizen.
Here's
a
look
at
some
of
the
lawsuits
from
the
opening
days
of
Trump's
presidency.
Darweesh
v.
Trump
Hameed
Khalid
Darweesh
worked
with
the
American
government
for
10
years
after
the
United
States
invaded
Iraq.
Another
Iraqi,
Haider
Sameer
Abdulkhaleq
Alshawi,
had
been
granted
a
visa
to
join
his
wife,
who
worked
for
an
American
contractor
in
Iraq,
and
son,
7,
both
of
whom
already
live
in
the
United
States
as
refugees.
The
two
men
were
detained
Saturday
at
John
F.
Kennedy
International
Airport,
setting
off
a
large
protest.
The
ACLU
and
other
groups
filed
a
class-action
lawsuit
--
the
first
to
challenge
Trump's
executive
order
on
immigration
--
on
behalf
of
the
men.
Separately,
the
Pentagon
is
compiling
names
of
people
who
supported
US
military
operations
in
Iraq
so
they
can
more
easily
receive
waivers
under
Trump's
executive
order
on
immigration,
Pentagon
spokesman
Capt.
Jeff
Davis
said.

CAIR's
lawsuit
The
Council
on
American
Islamic
Relations
on
Monday
filed
a
lawsuit
in
the
US
District
Court
for
the
Eastern
District
of
Virginia
on
behalf
of
27
named
and
unnamed
individuals
challenging
what
the
Muslim
civil
rights
organization
terms
Trump's
"Muslim
ban."
It
targets
Trump,
Department
of
Homeland
Security
Secretary
John
Kelly,
the
State
Department
and
the
Director
of
National
Intelligence.
The
White
House
has
repeatedly
said
its
travel
ban
is
not
based
on
religion
and
Trump
has
chastised
the
media
for
reporting
otherwise.
But
CAIR
alleges
that
the
"underlying
motive"
of
Trump's
executive
order
is
to
ban
people
of
the
Islamic
faith
from
entering
the
country.
"There
is
no
evidence
that
refugees
--
the
most
thoroughly
vetted
of
all
people
entering
our
nation
--
are
a
threat
to
national
security,"
Lena
Masri,
CAIR's
national
litigation
director,
said
in
a
statement.
"This
is
an
order
that
is
based
on
bigotry,
not
reality."

Suit
for
those
who
never
left
for
US
The
Arab
American
Civil
Rights
League
filed
suit
on
behalf
of
six
people
who
were
not
allowed
to
get
on
a
plane
back
to
the
United
States.
"This
is
addressing
those
individuals
that
are
stuck
overseas,
that
cannot
be
with
their
loved
ones,"
attorney
Nabih
Ayad,
founder
of
the
ACRL,
said
at
a
news
conference.
The
organization
said
the
six
people
live
in
the
Detroit
area.
The
suit
also
was
filed
on
behalf
of
people
in
similar
situations.
"Plaintiffs
file
this
present
suit
due
to
the
fact
that
the
existing
orders
do
not
encompass
green
card
holders
that
were
not
en
route
or
detained
by
the
United
States,"
the
lawsuit
says.

ACRL

Another
case
in
Virginia
A
federal
court
issued
a
temporary
restraining
order
saying
that
50
to
60
permanent
residents
returning
from
trips
abroad
should
have
access
to
lawyers
while
they
are
being
detained
at
Dulles
International
Airport
and
that
these
people
cannot
be
removed
from
the
United
States
for
seven
days.
The
motion
for
the
restraining
order,
filed
on
behalf
of
brothers
Tareq
Aqel
Mohammed
Aziz
and
Ammar
Aqel
Mohammed
Aziz,
said
that
without
counsel
the
detainees
could
not
meaningfully
understand
their
rights
and
obligations.
There
also
"exists
the
risk
that
petitioners
have
credible
fears
regarding
a
removal
from
the
United
States,
should
any
petitioner
be
sent
to
a
country
where
he
or
she
has
previously
been
the
subject
to
or
threatened
with
persecution,"
the
lawsuit
said.

Emoluments
Clause
Just
three
days
after
Trump
took
office,
the
Citizens
for
Responsibility
and
Ethics
in
Washington
sued
the
President,
alleging
that
Trump
violated
the
Emoluments
Clause
of
the
Constitution.
CREW
alleges
in
the
suit
filed
in
the
US
District
Court
for
the
Southern
District
of
New
York
that
the
clause
prohibits
Trump
from
accepting
anything
of
value
from
foreign
governments,
via
his
myriad
business
ventures
overseas.
Experts
differ
on
whether
the
case
is
a
viable
one,
and
Trump
lawyer
Sheri
Dillon
said
earlier
this
month
that
the
Constitution's
framers
never
considered
"that
paying
your
hotel
bill
was
an
emolument."
Also,
the
US
Supreme
Court
has
has
ruled
that
to
sue
in
federal
court,
plaintiffs
must
prove
a
concrete
and
particularized
injury.
CREW
has
said
that
Trump
is
forcing
it
to
"divert
essential
and
limited
sources"
from
its
government
watchdog
role,
forcing
the
organization
to
litigate
the
matter
and
educate
the
public
unless
a
court
stops
him.
In
a
column
for
The
New
York
Times
this
week,
Norman
Eisen
and
Richard
Painter
--
former
White
House
ethics
lawyers
who
now
serve,
respectively,
as
CREW's
chairman
and
vice
chairman
--
linked
the
emoluments
case
to
the
travel
ban.
The
seven
countries
affected
by
the
travel
ban
are
areas
where
the
President
has
done
business
in
his
previous
life,
they
said.
But
he
omitted
Saudi
Arabia,
the
United
Arab
Emirates,
Egypt,
Turkey,
India
and
the
Philippines
--
countries
Eisen
and
Painter
contend
have
and
do
pose
terror
threats
to
the

San
Francisco
sanctuary
city
San
Francisco
City
Attorney
Dennis
Herrera
filed
suit
Tuesday
against
the
Trump
administration
over
the
President's
order
targeting
sanctuary
cities.
The
White
House
has
threatened
to
withhold
federal
grants
from
any
"jurisdictions"
that
protect
undocumented
immigrants
and
decline
to
prosecute
them
for
violating
immigration
laws.
"The
president's
executive
order
is
not
only
unconstitutional,
it's
un-American,"
Herrera
said
in
a
statement.
"That
is
why
we
must
stand
up
and
oppose
it.
We
are
a
nation
of
immigrants
and
a
land
of
laws.
We
must
be
the
'guardians
of
our
democracy'
that
President
Obama
urged
us
all
to
be
in
his
farewell
address."
"Sanctuary
cities
have
less
crime,
fewer
people
in
poverty
and
lower
unemployment
than
other
counties,"
he
said,
citing
a
University
of
California,
San
Diego
study.
Herrera
accuses
Trump
of
exceeding
his
authority,
and
his
lawsuit
challenges
the
constitutionality
of
the
presidential
order
and
requests
a
finding
that
San
Francisco
is
complying
with
federal
law.

Texas
Labeeb
Ibrahim
Issa
worked
for
the
US
Army
in
Iraq
as
a
driver
and
general
maintenance
worker
when
he
was
injured
in
2016
after
being
targeted
for
his
work
helping
the
US,
according
to
a
lawsuit
filed
on
his
behalf
in
US
District
Court
for
the
Northern
District
of
Texas
on
Tuesday.
As
a
result
of
the
attack,
he
broke
his
pelvis
and
was
left
confined
to
a
wheelchair
to
be
able
to
move.
Because
of
threats
related
to
his
association
with
the
US
Army,
Issa
sought
a
special
immigrant
visa
on
January
13
and
demonstrated
the
ongoing
threat
he
was
experiencing,
according
to
court
documents.
He
was
granted
the
visa,
which
required
that
the
United
States
confirm
he
poses
no
security
threat
to
the
country,
the
lawsuit
states.
Issa
left
Iraq,
flying
from
Baghdad
to
Qatar,
with
plans
of
then
traveling
to
the
United
States.
In
Qatar,
however,
he
was
told
he
would
be
sent
back
to
Iraq
due
to
Trump's
travel
ban,
the
lawsuit
states.
Later,
Issa
was
told
he
could
enter
the
United
States
after
all,
the
lawsuit
states.
On
January
30,
Issa
arrived
at
Dallas
Fort
Worth
International
Airport
and
was
held
by
customs
officials
for
14
hours
before
an
attorney
could
request
an
emergency
hearing
to
have
him
released,
according
to
the
lawsuit.
He
was
released
30
minutes
later,

lawyers

Washington
state
"No
one
is
above
the
law
â€”
not
even
the
President,"
state
Attorney
General
Bob
Ferguson
said
in
filing
a
motion
for
a
restraining
order
to
halt
Trump's
executive
order.
This
was
in
addition
to
a
complaint
alleging
that
Trump's
order
is
"separating
Washington
families,
harming
thousands
of
Washington
residents,
damaging
Washington's
economy,
hurting
Washington-based
companies,
and
undermining
Washington's
sovereign
interest
in
remaining
a
welcoming
place
for
immigrants
and
refugees."
The
attorney
general
says
the
travel
ban
violates
the
Constitution's
First
Amendment
and
Equal
Protection
guarantee,
and
it
"contravenes
the
federal
Immigration
and
Nationality
Act."

Three

denied
entry
to

Philadelphia
International
Airport
over
the
weekend
plan
to
file
two
federal
lawsuits
against
the
Trump
administration
asking
that
family
members
be
admitted
into
the
country,
according
to
the
ACLU's
Philadelphia
chapter.
At
least
one
suit
will
be
filed
Tuesday
in
the
Eastern
District
of
Pennsylvania,
lawyers
said.
In
one
case,
when
family
members
of
legal
US
citizens
Sarmad
and
Sarah
Asali
arrived
in
Philadelphia
from
Doha,
Qatar,
they
were
told
they
could
have
their
visas
revoked
or
return
on
the
next
flight
to
Doha.
The
Asalis
told
CNN
their
family
members
--
who
are
Christian
Orthodox,
one
of
the
most
persecuted
groups
in
Syria
--
don't
speak
English
well
and
were
returned
to
Qatar.
"I
want
my
family
here
and
safe
regardless
of
what
it
takes,"

Mayor
Jim

associate
professors
--
Iranian
nationals
who
are

--
federal
judges
in

New
York
A
federal
judge
in
New
York
blocked
part
of
the
executive
order
Saturday,
ruling
that
authorities
could
not
remove
individuals
from
seven
Muslim-majority
countries
who
had
arrived
in
US
airports
with
valid
visas.
It
also
ordered
that
a
list
of
detainees
be
provided
to
the
ACLU,
but
no
list
was
provided.
State
Attorney
General
Eric
Schneiderman
asked
for
a
list
as
well,
as
well
as
assurances
that
the
Department
of
Homeland
Security
and
US
Customs
and
Border
Protection
were
complying
with
the
judge's
order.
On
Monday,
his
office
issued
a
statement:
"DHS
has
said
that
it
will
comply
with
the
federal
court
orders.
However,
we
continue
to
press
both
DHS
and
CBP
to
provide
a
full
list
of
those
who
are
currently
detained
and
allow
them
access
to
legal
service
providers."
On
Tuesday,
Schneiderman
said
his
office
would
join
a
federal
lawsuit,
filed
by
the
ACLU,
the
National
Immigration
Law
Center
and
others,
challenging
the
travel
ban.
Schneiderman
called
the
ban
unlawful
and
vowed
to
"protect
the
families
caught
in
the
chaos
sown
by
President
Trump's
hasty
and
irresponsible
implementation."
