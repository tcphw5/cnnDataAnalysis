(CNN)Former
President
Barack
Obama
criticized
President
Donald
Trump's
executive
order
curbing
immigration
in
a
statement
on
Monday,
backing
protesters
who
have
taken
to
the
nation's
airports
to
express
their
displeasure
with
Trump's
action
on
Friday.Frm

to
this
report."The
President
fundamentally
disagrees
with
the
notion
of
discriminating
against
individuals
because
of
their
faith
or
religion,"
said
Kevin
Lewis,
spokesman
for
the
former
president,
in
a
statement.
Lewis
added
Obama
feels
the
individuals
protesting
are
"exactly
what
we
expect
to
see
when
American
values
are
at
stake."
'I
do
feel
safer':
A
look
at
Trump's
travel
ban
supporters
This
is
first
time
Obama,
who
ceded
power
to
Trump
10
days
ago,
has
criticized
the
current
president,
breaking
with
an
unwritten
rule
that
former
presidents
refrain
from
criticizing
the
current
White
House
occupant.
It
is
also
the
former
president's
first
statement
since
leaving
the
White
House.
The
statement
also
rejected
the
comparison
between
a
2011
temporary
immigration
order
by
Obama
that
halted
Iraqis
coming
to
the
US
and
the
broader
ban
by
the
Trump
administration
on
citizens
of
seven
Muslim-majority
countries.
Former
presidents
walk
a
fine
line
between
staying
political
engaged
and
avoiding
knocking
their
successor.
President
George
W.
Bush,
for
example,
remained
markedly
silent
on
politics
during
Obama's
eight
years
in
office.
But
Obama's
relationship
with
Trump
is
different,
and
Monday's
statement
made
clear
that
the
former
president
will
stay
engaged
and
outspoken
on
political
action.
Trump's
order
temporarily
banned
immigration
from
Iran,
Iraq,
Syria,
Sudan,
Libya,
Yemen
and
Somalia
and
indefinitely
stopped
Syrian
refugees
from
coming
to
the
United
States.
Though
the
current
White
House
has
compared
Trump's
action
to
what
Obama
did
in
2011
when
"he
banned
visas
for
refugees
from
Iraq
for
six
months,"
Obama's
move
was
much
narrower
in
scope.
It
was
crafted
in
response
to
two
Iraqi
refugees
implicated
in
a
bomb
making
scheme
and
while
it
did
not
outright
ban
refugees
from
coming
to
the
United
States,
it
did
increase
the
amount
of
vetting
each
Iraqi
refugee
received.
Trump
defended
his
executive
order
Monday,
in
the
wake
of
protests
that
popped
up
across
the
country.
He
said
that
America
will
"continue
to
show
compassion
to
those
fleeing
oppression"
but
will
"do
so
while
protecting
our
own
citizens
and
border."
"I
have
tremendous
feeling
for
the
people
involved
in
this
horrific
humanitarian
crisis
in
Syria,"
Trump
said.
"My
first
priority
will
always
be
to
protect
and
serve
our
country,
but
as
President
I
will
find
ways
to
help
all
those
who
are
suffering."
