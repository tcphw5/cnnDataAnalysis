(CNN)KitKat
has
just
released
images
of
its
wild
new
"sushi"
sets
and
we
can't
decide
whether
to
be
relieved
or
upset
about
the
fact
they're
only
available
for
a
limited
time.
The
bars
come
in
three
flavors,
which
fortunately
don't
taste
anything
like
the
varieties
of
sushi
they're
modeled
to
look
like
--
unless
you
count
the
seaweed.
There's
tuna
sushi,
which
actually
tastes
like
raspberry.
The
seaweed
wrapped
sushi
omelet
is
really
a
pumpkin
pudding
KitKat.
Lastly,
the
sea
urchin
sushi
is
a
Hokkaido
melon
with
mascarpone
cheese
KitKat.
All
three
have
a
base
made
of
puffed
rice
with
white
chocolate
and
a
hint
of
wasabi.

How
Japan
went
crazy
for
KitKats
Inspired
by
an
April
Fool's
Day
joke
KitKat
has
long
been
famed
for
venturing
into
unusual
territory
in
Japan.
Wasabi,
lemon
vinegar
and
sake
are
among
the
300
varieties
of
KitKat
bars
to
go
on
sale
there
since
the
early
2000s.
Some
versions
have
managed
to
find
fans
in
overseas
markets,
too,
with
green
tea-flavored
KitKats
now
available
in
shops
worldwide.
But
this
is
the
first
time
the
brand
has
ever
released
a
set
inspired
by
sushi.
Reps
from
KitKat
owner
Nestle
say
it
all
started
with
a
2016
April
Fool's
Day
social
media
post
featuring
a
mock
advertisement
for
sushi
KitKats.
The
response
was
so
strong
they
decided
to
go
ahead
and
create
a
few
for
real.
Miki
Kanoh
of
Nestle
Japan's
Corporate
Affairs
Group
tells
CNN
the
special
edition
sets
will
be
given
out
to
visitors
who
spend
a
minimum
of
3,000
yen
($26.47)
at
Tokyo's
newest
KitKat
Chocolatory
shop,
located
in
Ginza,
from
February
2-14.
The
Ginza
branch
will
be
the
ninth
Chocolatory
but
the
first
on
ground
level.
Befitting
its
location
in
Tokyo's
swankiest
neighborhood,
shop
visitors
will
have
access
to
new
and
more
luxurious
services,
says
Nestle.
As
with
all
Chocolatory
stores,
it
will
offer
a
huge
range
of
KitKat
items,
many
of
which
come
in
beautiful
gift
packaging.
Sometime
in
the
next
few
months
a
cafe
serving
KitKat-based
items
will
open
on
the
second
floor
as
well.
Visitors
will
also
get
to
create
their
own
original
KitKats
using
the
toppings
of
their
choice.
