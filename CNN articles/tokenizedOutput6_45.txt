(CNN)In
the
end,
Judge
Thomas
Hardiman
only
drove
a
few
hours
east
of
Pittsburgh.
"The
reality
is
that
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
he
never
left
the
state
of
Pennsylvania,"
White
House
spokesman
Sean
Spicer
said
Tuesday
night
after
the
announcement.
"He
never
was
in
DC,
nor
did
he
ever
leave
the
commonwealth."
The
Trump
administration
was
taking
extraordinary
measures
to
build
suspense
and
keep
the
final
selection
for
its
Supreme
Court
nominee
under
wraps
for
as
close
to
the
announcement
as
possible.
Hardiman
and
Neil
Gorsuch,
both
federal
appellate
judges,
were
the
established
favorites.
Gorsuch
got
the
nod
at
the
White
House
Tuesday
night,
and
it
turns
out
Hardiman
never
made
it
to
Washington.
White
House
sources
acknowledged
Tuesday
night
they
left
the
impression
with
reporters
that
he
was
coming
to
Washington.
Hardiman
appeared
to
play
along.
One
source
said
Hardiman
was
given
the
sense
that
there
could
be
a
spot
for
him
should
another
vacancy
open
up.
Sources
inside
the
White
House
and
close
to
Hardiman
said
earlier
Tuesday
that
Hardiman
was
asked
to
come
to
Washington.
Other
news
outlets
reported
before
the
announcement
that
Hardiman
was
going
to
be
at
the
White
House
event,
though
CNN
was
never
told
that
was
the
intent.
After
he
was
seen
leaving
his
Pittsburgh
home,
a
CNN
producer
last
saw
Hardiman
again
at
a
highway
gas
station
more
than
100
miles
east
of
Pittsburgh
in
the
direction
of
Washington.
But
earlier
in
the
day,
sources
told
CNN
that
both
finalists
were
being
brought
to
Washington
ahead
of
Tuesday's
White
House
announcement.
One
source
said
that
Gorsuch
was
told
it
was
likely
him.
Those
close
to
the
process
warned
that
until
it
was
announced,
Trump
could
change
his
mind.
"He
likes
a
contest,"
one
person
close
to
the
process
said
of
Trump.
Two
packets
of
briefing
materials
were
being
prepared
to
give
senators
Tuesday
night:
Gorsuch
and
Hardiman.
But
one
person
said
the
"Gorsuch
packet"
was
full
and
complete,
while
Hardiman's
was
little
more
than
biographical.
One
person
close
to
the
process
said
Trump
doesn't
view
runner-up
as
a
bad
thing.
"There
will
be
other
openings
on
the
court,
so
the
person
not
picked
will
be
runner-up,"
this
person
said.
Key
Trump
selections
have
been
dramatic
before.
When
he
was
selecting
his
vice
presidential
choice
it
was
reported
that
even
after
Mike
Pence
was
selected
but
before
it
was
announced,
Trump
asked
his
team
if
he
could
change
his
mind.
Additionally,
after
CNN
reported
that
Trump
was
set
to
announce
General
James
Mattis
to
be
his
secretary
of
defense
at
a
rally,
his
team
openly
denied
the
choice
in
the
hours
before
Trump
went
ahead
and
announced
it
on
stage.
This
story
has
been
updated
throughout
to
reflect
new
reporting
on
Hardiman's
activities
and
the
White
House's
plans.
