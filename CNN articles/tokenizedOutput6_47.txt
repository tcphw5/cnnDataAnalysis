(CNN)A
10-year-old
girl
in
Bangladesh
is
being
treated
for
the
extremely
rare
condition
known
as
"tree
man"
syndrome.See

CNN
Health
on
Facebook
and
Twitter.Sahana
Khatun
was
admitted
to
Dhaka
Medical
College
and
Hospital
on
Sunday
with
unusual
marks
and
growths
on
her
face.
"She
has
bark-like
warts
growing
on
her
chin,
nose
and
ear,"
Dr.
Samanta
Lal
Sen,
chief
plastic
surgeon
at
the
hospital,
told
CNN.
Sahana
first
developed
the
disease
eight
years
ago,
when
her
father
found
some
rashes
on
her
face.
Only
since
last
year
have
the
tree-like
warts
begun
sprouting
on
her
face.
The
symptoms
are
thought
to
be
that
of
epidermodysplasia
verruciformis,
a
rare,
heritable
disease;
there
have
only
been
a
handful
cases
reported
around
the
world.
Those
with
the
condition
are
likely
to
develop
malignant
skin
tumors.
"We
don't
know
yet
if
this
is
(one)
hundred
percent
a
'tree
man'
syndrome,
but
it
definitely
is
a
variety
of
the
epidermodysplasia
verruciformis,
disease
which
causes
very
unusual
skin
disorder,"
Lal
Sen
said.
The
condition
is
caused
by
a
defect
in
the
immune
system
which
increases
one's
susceptibility
to
cutaneous
HPV,
or
human
papillomavirus.
Sahana
lost
her
mother
when
she
was
6
and
lives
with
her
father,
a
laborer.
"Due
to
a
weak
financial
condition
of
the
family,
(the)
hospital
is
bearing
all
of
their
medical
and
personal
costs"
Lal
Sen
said.
Doctors
at
the
hospital
are
planning
to
operate
and
remove
Sahana's
lesions
as
early
as
next
week.
Lal
Sen
said
her
condition
is
not
very
serious
and
since
she
has
a
milder
form
of
the
disease,
the
team
is
confident
that
they
can
clear
Sahana's
face
within
one
surgery.
'I
want
to
live
like
a
normal
person'
Abul
Bajandar,
the
well-known
"tree
man"
of
Bangladesh
is
going
through
treatment
at
the
same
hospital.
After
many
groundbreaking
surgeries,
doctors
were
able
to
remove
the
tree-like
branches
that
were
growing
out
from
his
fingers,
palms
and
feet.
Bajandar,
27,
lived
with
his
growths
for
years
before
beginning
surgery
to
remove
the
them
last
February.
Since
then
he
has
had
19
procedures
to
restore
his
hands,
and
will
undergo
a
few
before
he
is
released
from
the
hospital.
Before
the
surgery,
Bajandar
could
not
eat,
drink,
brush
his
teeth
or
take
a
shower
by
himself.
The
only
thing
he
could
do
was
scratch
his
neck.
Lal
Sen
told
CNN
that
Bajandar
is
now
in
"very
good
shape,"
and
can
eat
and
write
using
his
own
hands.
The
final
procedures,
he
said,
are
more
for
"beautification."
"I
want
to
live
like
a
normal
person.
I
just
want
to
be
able
to
hold
my
daughter
properly
and
hug
her,"
Bajandar
told
CNN
last
year.
The
doctors
hope
to
now
offer
similar
hope
to
young
Sahana.
