(CNN)The
White
House
statement
on
International
Holocaust
Remembrance
Day
didn't
mention
Jews
or
anti-Semitism
because
"despite
what
the
media
reports,
we
are
an
incredibly
inclusive
group
and
we
took
into
account
all
of
those
who
suffered,"
administration
spokeswoman
Hope
Hicks
told
CNN
on
Saturday.Hicks
provided
a
link
to
a
Huffington
Post
UK
story
noting
that
while
6
million
Jews
were
killed
by
the
Nazis,
5
million
others
were
also
slaughtered
during
Adolf
Hitler's
genocide,
including
"priests,
gypsies,
people
with
mental
or
physical
disabilities,
communists,
trade
unionists,
Jehovah's
Witnesses,
anarchists,
Poles
and
other
Slavic
peoples,
and
resistance
fighters."
Asked
if
the
White
House
was
suggesting
President
Donald
Trump
didn't
mention
Jews
as
victims
of
the
Holocaust
because
he
didn't
want
to
offend
the
other
people
the
Nazis
targeted
and
killed,
Hicks
replied,
"it
was
our
honor
to
issue
a
statement
in
remembrance
of
this
important
day."
The
presidential
reference
to
the
"innocent
people"
victimized
by
the
Nazis
without
a
mention
of
Jews
or
anti-Semitism
by
the
White
House
on
International
Holocaust
Remembrance
Day
was
a
stark
contrast
to
statements
by
former
Presidents
George
W.
Bush
and
Barack
Obama.
Anti-Defamation
League
Director
Jonathan
Greenblatt
tweeted
that
the
"@WhiteHouse
statement
on
#HolocaustMemorialDay,
misses
that
it
was
six
million
Jews
who
perished,
not
just
'innocent
people'"
and
"Puzzling
and

presidents
have
done
so
in
the
past."
Asked
about
the
White
House
explanation
that
the
President
didn't
want
to
exclude
any
of
the
other
groups
Nazis
killed
by
specifically
mentioning
Jews,
Greenblatt
told
CNN
that
the
United
Nations
established
International
Holocaust
Remembrance
Day
not
only
because
of
Holocaust
denial
but
also
because
so
many
countries
--
Iran,
Russia
and
Hungary,
for
example
--
specifically
refuse
to
acknowledge
Hitler's
attempt
to
exterminate
Jews,
"opting
instead
to
talk
about
generic
suffering
rather
than
recognizing
this
catastrophic
incident
for
what
is
was:
the
intended
genocide
of
the
Jewish
people."
Downplaying
or
disregarding
the
degree
to
which
Jews
were
targeted
for
elimination
during
the
Holocaust
is
a
common
theme
of
nationalist
movements
like
those
seen
in
Russia
and
Eastern
Europe,
Greenblatt
said.
Initially,
after
being
asked
about
the
ADL
criticism
and
the
omission
of
any
mention
of
Jews
or
anti-Semitism,
Hicks
provided
a
statement
from
Ronald
Lauder
of
the
World
Jewish
Congress
that
seemed
to
criticize
Greenblatt
and
the
ADL.
"It
does
no
honor
to
the
millions
of
Jews
murdered
in
the
Holocaust
to
play
politics
with
their
memory,"
the
Lauder
statement
read
in
part.
"Any
fair
reading
of
the
White
House
statement
today
on
the
International
Holocaust
Memorial
Day
will
see
it
appropriately
commemorates
the
suffering
and
the
heroism
that
mark
that
dark
chapter
in
modern
history."
Editor's
note
February

2017:
This
article
has
been
updated
to
correct
an
erroneous
statement
by
ADL
director
Jonathan
Greenblatt
about
Poland's
recognition
of
the
Jewish
victims
of
the
Holocaust.
The
ADL
has
retracted
that
comment
and
apologized.
"I
made
a
mistake
by
including
Poland
as
one
of
the
countries
which
does
not
always
recognize
the
Jewish
people
as
the
intended
target
of
the
Nazi
genocide,"
Greenblatt
said
in
a
letter
to
the
Polish
ambassador.
"I
regret
this
mistake,
and
want
to
assure
you
that
it
was
not
intended
as
an
affront
to
your
government
or
the
people
of
Poland."
