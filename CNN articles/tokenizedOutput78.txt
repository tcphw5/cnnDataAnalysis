President
Donald
Trump
may
be
having
his
biggest
day
of
diplomacy
yet,
speaking
by
phone
Saturday
with
five
world
leaders
--

Laura
Goehler
and
Mansur
Mirovalev
contributed
to
this
report.It
was
Trump's
first
phone
conversation
with
the
Russian
President
since
his
inauguration
last
week,
and
one
whose
outcome
will
be
closely
studied.
CNN's
Matthew
Chance
in
Moscow
said
a
Kremlin
summary
of
the
phone
call
talked
about
stabilizing
the
relationship
between
the
two
nations
and
several
other
subjects.
Some
of
the
other
issues
included
restoring
trade
ties,
international
terrorism,
the
situations
in
Ukraine
and
the
Korean
Peninsula,
and
the
coordination
of
military
action
against
ISIS
and
other
terrorist
groups
in
Syria.
The
Kremlin
call
summary
didn't
specifically
mention
US
sanctions
against
Russia.
It
said
restoration
of
mutually
beneficial
economic
ties
"could
further
stimulate
progressive
and
stable
development
of
bilateral
relations,"
according
to
a
CNN
translation
of
the
Russian
statement.
The
White
House
called
the
one-hour
chat
a
significant
start
to
improving
a
relationship
"in
need
of
repair."
Both
Trump
and
Putin
said
before
the
call
that
they
would
like
to
see
warmer
ties
between
their
two
nations.
However,
relations
between
Trump
and
his
team
and
Russia
have
been
under
scrutiny
following
allegations
that
Moscow
meddled
in
the
US
election
last
year.
Speaking
Friday
at
his
first
White
House
news
conference,
Trump
indicated
a
willingness
to
work
with
Moscow.
But
he
said
it
was
"too
early"
to
discuss
removing
sanctions
that
his
predecessor,
President
Barack
Obama,
imposed
on
Russia.
"We're
looking
to
have
a
great
relationship
with
all
countries,"
Trump
said.
"If
we
can
have
a
great
relationship
with
Russia
and
China
and
all
countries,
I'm
all
for
that."
Friday
night,
however,
a
senior
administration
official
said
the
current
plan
was
not
to
lift
the
Russian
sanctions.
The
Kremlin
had
sought
to
lower
expectations,
suggesting
Putin
was
calling
as
a
matter
of
protocol
to
congratulate
the
US
leader
on
his
inauguration.
But
there
is
excitement
in
Russia
about
a
possible
detente
between
Washington
and
Moscow
under
the
Trump
administration.
Besides
imposing
the
Russian
sanctions,
Obama
earlier
this
month
expelled
35
Russian
diplomats
from
the
United
States
over
alleged
Russian
interference
in
the
2016
election.
Flurry
of
calls
Before
speaking
with
Putin,
Trump
held
a
call
with
Merkel
and
spoke
to
Japanese
Prime
Minister
Shinzo
Abe,
a
key
ally
in
Asia.
The
45-minute
phone
call
between
Trump
and
Abe
included
a
discussion
of
the
threat
posed
by
North
Korea,
and
both
leaders
agreed
to
speak
face
to
face
in
Washington
on
February
10.
Abe
and
Trump
also
discussed
the
significance
of
Defense
Secretary
James
Mattis'
upcoming
visit
to
Asia,
according
to
the
White
House.
Later
Saturday,
Trump
was
to
speak
with
French
President
François
Hollande
and
Australian
Prime
Minister
Malcolm
Turnbull.
Trump's
calls
with
Abe
and
Turnbull
come
days
after
he
signed
an
executive
order
withdrawing
the
United
States
from
the
Trans-Pacific
Partnership,
or
TPP,
a
massive
trade
deal
negotiated
by
the
Obama
administration
that
Congress
had
not
yet
ratified.
Both
Abe
and
Turnbull
supported
TPP.
The
call
between
Trump
and
Abe
did
not
include
a
discussion
on
a
replacement
for
the
TPP,
a
high-ranking
Japanese
government
official
told
reporters.
The
flurry
of
telephone
diplomacy
comes
a
day
after
Trump
received
his
first
foreign
leader
at
the
White
House,
UK
Prime
Minister
Theresa
May,
who
announced
that
Trump
will
make
a
state
visit
to
the
United
Kingdom.
In
a
speech
to
US
Republicans,
May
urged
Trump
to
tread
carefully
as
he
deals
with
Russia,
saying:
"With
President
Putin,
my
advice
is
to
engage
but
beware."
Trump
also
spoke
by
phone
Friday
with
Mexican
President
Enrique
Peña
Nieto
after
a
row
over
Trump's
plans
for
a
wall
along
the
US-Mexico
border
culminated
in
Peña
Nieto
canceling
a
planned
trip
to
Washington.
Fences
to
mend?
Trump's
call
with
the
German
Chancellor
was
likely
not
the
easiest
of
the
day.
In
an
interview
this
month
with
The
Times
newspaper
in
London
and
the
German
publication
Bild,
the
US
President
called
Merkel
"by
far
the
most
important
leader"
in
Europe
--
but
was
critical
of
the
welcome
she
has
extended
to
refugees.
"I
think
she
made
one
very
catastrophic
mistake
and
that
was
taking
all
of
these
illegals,
you
know
taking
all
of
the
people
from
wherever
they
come
from.
And
nobody
even
knows
where
they
come
from,"
Trump
said
in
that
interview.
He
also
appeared
to
undermine
the
European
Union,
currently
grappling
with
the
prospect
of
Britain's
exit,
saying:
"You
look
at
the
European
Union
and
it's
Germany.
Basically
a
vehicle
for
Germany.
That's
why
I
thought
the
UK
was
so
smart
in
getting
out."
Merkel,
who
is
running
for
a
fourth
term
in
office
later
this
year
and
faces
criticism
from
political
opponents
over
her
refugee
policy,
declined
to
comment
on
Trump's
remarks.
In
their
call
Saturday,
Trump
and
Merkel
discussed
NATO
and
other
topics,
officials
said.
"The
leaders
recognized
that
NATO
must
be
capable
of
confronting
21st-century
threats
and
that
our
common
defense
requires
appropriate
investment
in
military
capabilities
to
ensure
all
Allies
are
contributing
their
fair
share
to
our
collective
security,"
the
White
House
reported.
A
German
statement
used
the
phrasing
"common
defense
investment
in
military
capabilities
and
a
fair
contribution
of
all
allies."
Trump
will
attend
the
G20
summit
in
Hamburg,
Germany,
in
July,
the
two
statements
said.
Hollande
outspoken
Trump
may
also
have
to
build
bridges
with
France,
traditionally
a
close
ally
of
the
United
States.
Hollande,
who
plans
to
stand
down
as
president
this
spring,
was
outspoken
at
a
joint
news
conference
Friday
with
Merkel
about
the
"challenges"
the
Trump
administration
poses
for
Europe
in
terms
of
trade
and
global
diplomacy.
"We
of
course
have
to
speak
to
Donald
Trump,
as
he
was
chosen
by
the
Americans
to
be
their
president.
But
we
have
to
do
it
with
a
European
point
of
view
and
promote
our
interests
and
values,"
he
said
in
Berlin.
The
French
government
said
Hollande
referred
to
NATO
as
indispensible
and
also
told
Trump
the
nuclear
agreement
with
Iran
needs
to
be
respected
and
fully
implemented.
Hollande
added
that
the
nations
should
be
vigilant
with
Tehran.
The
French
President
told
the
new
American
leader
that
situation
in
Syria
requires
a
political
solution
and
the
involvement
of
the
United
Nations,
according
to
the
French
statement.
As
to
the
crisis
in
eastern
Ukraine,
Hollande
said
sanctions
must
stay
in
place
until
the
Minsk
agreement
is
implemented.
The
White
House
said
Trump
offered
condolences
for
the
loss
of
life
in
terrorist
attacks
in
France
and
discussed
his
desire
to
cooperate
more
on
counterterrorism
and
security.
"The
leaders
also
lauded
our
combined
efforts
to
eliminate
ISIS
in
Iraq
and
Syria,"
the
White
House
statement
said.
It
also
said
Trump,
as
in
the
other
calls,
reiterated
the
US
committment
to
NATO
and
the
importance
of
allies
sharing
costs.
