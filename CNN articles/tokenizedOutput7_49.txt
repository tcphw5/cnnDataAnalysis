(CNN)The
West
Wing
has
been
churning
out
news
non-stop
since
President
Donald
Trump
took
office,
but
the
East
Wing
has
quite
literally
remained
dark.
CNN's
Noah
Gray
contributed
to
this
report.It's
been
12
days
since
the
last
public
sighting
of
first
lady
Melania
Trump,
who
had
been
planning
on
splitting
her
time
between
Washington
and
New
York,
where
the
couple's
son,
Barron,
is
completing
the
school
year.
And
when
a
solemn
scene
unfolded
Wednesday
afternoon
as
Trump
boarded
Marine
One
to
pay
his
respects
to
a
fallen
service
member's
family
in
Delaware,
he
was
accompanied
by
first
daughter,
Ivanka
--
a
reminder
that
she
is
his
closest
family
in
Washington.
Melania
Trump's
last
public
appearance
was
on
January
21,
when
she
went
to
the
post-inauguration
multi-faith
prayer
service
at
Washington's
National
Cathedral.
The
next
day,
which
coincided
with
the
couple's
12th
wedding
anniversary,
Melania
Trump
returned
to
New
York
City,
Barron
in
tow.
A
spokeswoman
for
the
first
lady
told
CNN
Trump
would
be
returning
to
Trump
Tower
--
temporarily.
"The
first
lady
thanks
everyone
for
their
support
and
a
beautiful
welcome
to
Washington.
She
is
returning
to
New
York
in
advance
of
the
school
week
and
will
be
splitting
her
time
between
Washington
and
New
York
for
the
next
few
weeks,"
the
spokeswoman
said.
She
has
not
been
back
to
DC
since.
Despite
this,
a
spokeswoman
for
the
first
lady
knocked
down
recent
reports
that
the
Melania
Trump
would
not
be
moving
to
Washington
at
all.
"That
report
is
not
true,"
the
spokeswoman
said.
Later
Wednesday,
Stephanie
Winston
Wolkoff,
acting
as
senior
adviser
to
the
first
lady,
confirmed
Melania
Trump
will
move
to
Washington.
"Mrs.
Trump
will
be
moving
to
DC
and
settling
in
to
the
White
House
at
the
end
of
the
school
year,
splitting
her
time
between
New
York
and
DC
in
the
meantime,"
she
said.
"Mrs.
Trump
is
honored
to
serve
this
country
and
is
taking
the
role
and
responsibilities
of
first
lady
very
seriously.
It
has
only
been
a
short
time
since
the
inauguration
and
the
first
lady
is
going
to
go
about
her
role
in
a
pragmatic
and
thoughtful
way
that
is
unique
and
authentic
to
her."
But
for
now,
without
a
full-time
first
lady,
the
typical
duties
of
that
part
of
the
White
House
machine
are
at
a
veritable
standstill.
On
Wednesday
evening,
the
first
lady's
office
shifted
into
a
more
active
gear,
announcing
the
hiring
of
Lindsay
Reynolds,
a
former
associate
director
of
the
White
House
Visitor's
Office
during
the
George
W.
Bush
administration,
to
be
Trump's
chief
of
staff.
"I
am
putting
together
a
professional
and
highly-experienced
team
which
will
take
time
to
do
properly.
I
am
excited
to
be
organizing
and
bringing
together
such
a
dynamic
and
forward
thinking
group
of
individuals
who
will
work
together
to
make
our
country
better
for
everyone,"
Trump
said
in
a
statement.
But
the
first
lady
largely
hasn't
filled
out
a
staff,
including
a
communications
director
and
social
secretary.
Trump
also
hasn't
formally
announced
a
platform
of
official
causes,
a
social
schedule
of
events,
nor
her
Washington
calendar.
On
Monday
night,
paparazzi
caught
the
first
lady
and
Barron
"running
errands"
in
New
York
City.
Melania
Trump,
in
a
cream-colored
coat
and
signature
five-inch
high
heels,
and
Barron,
were
ferried
around
Manhattan
by
a
Secret
Service
detail.
During
the
transition,
the
President
told
reporters
said
his
wife
and
youngest
son
would
join
him
"very
soon.
Right
after
he
finishes
school."
And
in
an
interview
with
New
York
Times
last
week,
Trump
said
that
Melania
and
Barron,
10,
would
be
at
the
White
House
on
weekends.
The
White
House
declined
a
CNN
request
for
comment
on
the
first
lady's
whereabouts.
But
sources
inside
Pennsylvania
Avenue
said
Melania
Trump
hasn't
been
seen
at
the
White
House
since
inaugural
weekend.
She
is
expected
to
join
her
husband
at
Mar-a-Lago
this
weekend,
a
White
House
official
confirmed
Wednesday.
Also
missing?
The
first
lady's
staff.
With
spots
open
for
at
least
20-30
East
Wing
positions
--
from
the
social
office
to
the
communications
team
and
public
outreach
--
there
have
been
zero
officials
hires.
Melania
Trump
has
been
actively
been
conducting
interviews
for
staffing
posts
over
the
past
several
weeks,
though,
and
some
names
have
been
floated.
Melania
Trump
made
few
public
appearances
on
the
campaign
trail.
She
did
deliver
a
high-profile
speech
at
the
Republican
National
Convention
in
August,
a
performance
quickly
enveloped
in
controversy
when
it
was
discovered
she
plagiarized
part
of
her
speech
from
Michelle
Obama.
But
her
speech
also
provided
a
rare
insight
into
her
relationship
with
the
President:
"He
is
tough
when
he
has
to
be,
but
he
is
also
kind
and
fair
and
caring.
This
kindness
is
not
always
noted,
but
it
is
there
for
all
to
see.
That
is
one
reason
I
fell
in
love
with
him
to
begin
with,"
she
had
said
in
Cleveland.
She
also
defended
her
husband
to
CNN's
Anderson
Cooper
when
the
Access
Hollywood
tapes
were
released,
calling
it
"boy
talk."
"I
said
to
my
husband
that,
you
know,
the
language
was
inappropriate.
It's
not
acceptable.
And
I
was
surprised,
because
that
is
not
the
man
that
I
know,"
she
said
in
October.
"I
accept
his
apology.
I
hope
the
American
people
will
accept
it
as
well.
And
it
was
many,
many
years
ago.
He's
not
the
man
that
I
know."
