(CNN)Every
year
since
1995,
a
mystery
illness
has
plagued
the
town
of
Muzaffarpur
in
Bihar,
India.See
the
latest

with
CNN
Health
on
Facebook
and
Twitter.Around
May
and
June
each
year,
large
numbers
of
young
children
would
start
showing
signs
of
fever.
They'd
have
seizures
and
convulsions,
before
slipping
in
and
out
of
consciousness.
In
2014,
hundreds
of
children
were
admitted
to
hospital
exhibiting
symptoms
of
this
illness,
branded
locally
as
"chamki
ki
bimari,"
or
"tinsel
disease."
Of
390
admitted
for
treatment,
122
died.
Teams
of
researchers
and
medical
experts
searched
exhaustively
to
find
the
cause,
but
to
no
avail.
Until
now.
A
new
report,
published
in
The
Lancet
Global
Health
medical
journal
on
Tuesday,
claims
to
have
discovered
what's
behind
the
devastating
disease:
the
unassuming
lychee,
otherwise
known
as
litchi.
Heat,
humidity,
malnourishment,
the
monsoon
and
pesticides
have
all
been
considered
at
one
stage
to
be
contributing
factors
to
the
illness
--
said
to
resemble
encephalitis
symptomatically,
a
disease
that
causes
inflammation
of
the
brain.
Killer
fruit?
Researchers
from
the
US
Centers
for
Disease
Control
and
Prevention
and
India's
National
Centre
for
Disease
Control
compared
test
results
of
children
who
had
developed
the
mysterious
illness,
and
children
who
had
not.
Analysis
of
blood
and
spinal
fluid
samples
showed
no
signs
of
infection
or
exposure
to
chemicals
and
insecticides.
However,
most
of
the
children
who
had
fallen
ill
had
eaten
lychee
fruit
recently.
They
were
also
six
times
more
likely
to
have
visited
a
fruit
orchard
in
the
last
24
hours,
the
study
said.
Muzaffarpur,
Bihar,
is
the
largest
lychee
farming
region
in
India.
According
to
the
study,
parents
reported
that
children
in
the
affected
villages
spent
most
of
the
day
eating
lychees
from
the
surrounding
orchards,
often
returning
home
in
the
evening
"uninterested
in
eating
a
meal."
The
results
said
that
children
who
fell
ill
were
twice
as
likely
to
have
skipped
dinner,
which,
according
to
the
researchers
probably
resulted
in
"night-time
hypoglycaemia."
When
their
blood
sugar
level
dropped,
the
body
would
start
to
metabolize
fatty
acids
to
produce
a
necessary
boost
of
glucose.
However,
urine
samples
showed
that
two-thirds
of
the
ill
children
showed
evidence
of
exposure
to
toxins
found
in
lychee
seeds
--
found
in
higher
levels
in
unripe
fruits.
In
the
presence
of
these
toxins
"glucose
synthesis
is
severely
impaired,"
the
study
said,
leading
to
dangerously
low
blood
sugar
and
brain
inflammation
in
the
children.
'Unidentified
genetic
differences'
The
Indian
government
issued
a
statement
Wednesday
advising
children
to
henceforth
"minimize
litchi
fruit
consumption"
in
affected
areas,
and
eat
an
evening
meal
during
the
"outbreak
period."
However,
the
researchers
said
there
are
still
some
questions
surrounding
the
mystery.
For
example,
while
orchards
surround
many
villages
in
the
area,
typically
only
one
child
in
each
village
develops
the
illness.
The
report
suggests
it
may
be
something
to
do
with
genetics.
"The
synergistic
combination
of
litchi
consumption,
a
missed
evening
meal,
and
other
potential
factors
such
as
poor
nutritional
status,
eating
a
greater
number
of
litchis,
and
as
yet
unidentified
genetic
differences
might
be
needed
to
produce
this
illness,"
the
study
said.
However,
it
added
that
similar
outbreaks
had
been
reported
in
another
lychee
cultivation
areas
in
West
Bengal,
and
also
beyond
India
in
parts
of
Vietnam
and
Bangladesh.
Previous
research
had
focused
on
pesticides
rather
than
the
fruit
itself,
but
"the
findings
of
our
investigations
might
help
to
shed
light
on
the
cause
of
illness
in
the
Bangladesh
and
Vietnam
outbreaks,"
the
study
said.
