(CNN)The
traditional
function
of
bullets
is
killing,
but
a
new
design
could
have
the
opposite
effect.
The
US
army
is
seeking
proposals
for
biodegradable
ammunition
to
replace
the
existing
rounds
used
in
training
--
including
grenade
and
tank
rounds
-
citing
environmental
concerns.
"Components
of
current
training
rounds
require
hundreds
of
years
or
more
to
biodegrade,"
states
the
Department
of
Defense
brief.
"Some
of
these
rounds
might
have
the
potential
to
corrode
and
pollute
the
soil
and
nearby
water."
The
DoD
stipulates
that
the
new
ammunition
should,
instead,
contain
seeds
that
produce
food
for
animals:
"This
effort
will
make
use
of
seeds
to
grow
environmentally
friendly
plants
that
remove
soil
contaminants
and
consume
the
biodegradable
components
developed
under
this
project.
Animals
should
be
able
to
consume
the
plants
without
any
ill
effects."
This
eye-catching
proposal
may
seem
far-fetched,
but
the
brief
goes
on
to
claim
that
US
army
researchers
have
already
succeeded
in
embedding
seeds
into
biodegradable
material
to
flower
months
later.
Ripe
targets
Military
facilities
account
for
900
of
the
1300
most
polluted
sites
in
the
US,
according
to
the
Environmental
Protection
Agency
(EPA).
A
comprehensive
clean-up
could
cost
$165
billion,
according
to
the
DoD.
Much
of
the
damage
is
historic,
pre-dating
awareness
of
environmental
issues.
"(Military
bases)
tend
to
have
older
buildings
with
lead
paint
and
asbestos
problems,"
says
Skip
Kazmarek,
an
environmental
lawyer
who
has
studied
military
sites.
"If
a
base
was
operating
in
World
War
Two
it
might
have
burn
pits
for
waste
oil
and
solvents,
and
it
can
be
a
pretty
nasty
area."
But
modern
sites
also
generate
toxic
waste;
from
burning
explosives
to
chemical
leaks
and
heavy
metal
deposits
--
including
massive
lead
pollution.
Lead
poisoning
can
cause
serious
health
conditions
including
brain
damage,
as
well
as
polluting
the
environment.
Millions
of
lead
bullets
are
fired
each
year
on
military
firing
ranges,
which
rapidly
reach
high
levels
of
contamination
according
to
an
Environmental
Working
Group
report.
"The
lead
in
ammunition
tends
to
build
up
over
years
and
it
can
leach
into
groundwater
and
pose
threats
to
wildlife,"
says
Kazmarek.
"You
could
improve
environmental
quality
with
a
change
from
lead
bullets."
The
future's
green?
Efforts
to
produce
sustainable
ammunition
are
intensifying,
and
producing
a
series
of
innovations.
The
US
army
has
experimented
with
tungsten
bullets,
but
reverted
to
lead
over
health
risks.
Canada
recently
unveiled
a
new
"green"
bullet
designed
to
reduce
contamination.
"This
idea
of
reducing
toxic
metal
poisoning
has
been
gaining
traction
for
the
past
25
years,"
says
Nic
Jenzen-Jones,
director
of
the
Armament
Research
Services.
"Particularly
over
the
last
10
years
there
has
been
a
push
towards
assessing
the
projectiles
of
different
weapon
systems
to
see
if
they
can
be
made
less
harmful
to
users
and
the
environment."
Western
militaries
are
scaling
up
research
and
development
of
ammunition
with
a
neutral
or
positive
environmental
impact,
says
Jenzen-Jones,
citing
the
progress
of
Norwegian
company
Nammo
in
producing
lead-free
bullets
that
have
been
adopted
by
the
Swedish
army.
There
are
hurdles
to
overcome
--
such
as
cost,
performance
and
compatibility
with
existing
equipment
--
but
the
arms
expert
believes
that
sustainability
has
become
a
priority.
"Militaries
understand
the
cost
trade-off
of
going
green
(and)
they
are
happy
to
spend
a
little
more
to
receive
the
environmental
benefits,"
says
Jenzen-Jones.
He
points
to
the
DoD's
increasing
role
in
conservation
and
species
protection
as
a
sign
of
intent.
Military
practices
could
follow
the
example
of
sport
shooting,
which
has
pioneered
sustainable
ammunition.
Nations
such
as
Denmark
have
banned
lead
bullets
for
hunting,
and
former
President
Obama
made
one
of
his
final
commands
a
crackdown
on
their
use
in
wildlife
refuges.
Hunters
are
also
leading
civil
society
campaigns
against
lead
pollution.
The
edible
grenades
may
be
some
time
in
arriving,
but
the
US
army
appears
ready
to
do
battle
with
its
toxic
footprint.
