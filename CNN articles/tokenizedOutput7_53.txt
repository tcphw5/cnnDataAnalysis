(CNN)President
Donald
Trump's
National
Security
Advisor
Michael
Flynn
condemned
Wednesday
Iran's
recent
ballistic
missile
test
launch,
calling
it
a
"provocative"
breach
of
a
UN
Security
Council
resolution.Flynn
called
the
launch
the
latest
in
a
series
of
provocative
moves
by
Iran
that
have
included
backing
Houthi
rebels
in
Yemen,
who
have
attacked
US
allies.
"As
of
today,
we
are
officially
putting
Iran
on
notice,"
Flynn
said
from
the
White
House
briefing
room.
Flynn
did
not
say
whether
the
US
would
take
action
beyond
a
verbal
warning,
and
three
senior
administration
officials,
speaking
on
background,
said
Wednesday
that
they
are
still
in
the
early
stages
of
determining
what
action
the
US
should
take
in
response.
"We
are
considering
a
whole
range
of
options.
We're
in
a
deliberative
process,"
one
of
the
officials
said.
Those
options
include
financial
measures
and
economic
sanctions,
and
the
officials
said
the
administration
would
not
take
any
options
off
the
table,
including
a
military
response.
They
also
stressed
that
a
violation
of
the
UN
Security
Council
Resolution
on
Iranian
ballistic
missile
activity
would
not
impact
the
Iran
nuclear
deal.
One
of
the
officials
said
Flynn's
warning
on
Wednesday
delivered
from
the
White
House
--
one
that
might
typically
be
issued
by
diplomats
--
was
intended
to
reflect
"the
level
of
importance
that
this
administration
believes
this
issue
warrants."
'Provocative'
Iran's
Foreign
Ministry
insisted
Tuesday
that
Sunday's
missile
test
was
"solely
for
defensive
purposes,"
and
not
a
violation
of
the
UN
Security
Council
resolution
which
bars
Iran
from
testing
"ballistic
missiles
designed
to
be
capable
of
delivering
nuclear
weapons."
President
Barack
Obama's
administration
one
year
ago
enacted
financial
sanctions
on
11
people
and
companies
involved
in
Iran's
ballistic
missile
program
after
the
country
conducted
two
test
launches
of
ballistic
missiles.
That
came
after
the
UN
determined
in
late
2015
that
those
launches
were
in
violation
of
the
Security
Council
resolution.
The
UN
Security
Council
Resolution
is
not
part
of
the
Iran
nuclear
deal,
but
a
separate
security
council
measure.
Flynn
did
not
signal
whether
the
US
would
take
any
concrete
actions
--
military
or
diplomatic
--
to
counter
what
he
described
as
"provocative"
Iranian
actions,
but
he
did
criticize
the
Obama
administration
for
having
"failed
to
respond
adequately
to
Iran's
maligned
actions."
Flynn
added
that
Iran's
actions
threaten
stability
in
the
region
and
place
American
lives
at
risk,
and
said
Iran
was
"on
notice."
"The
Trump
administration
condemns
such
actions
by
Iran
that
undermine
security,
prosperity
and
stability
throughout
and
beyond
the
Middle
East
and
place
American
lives
at
risk,"
he
said.
White
House
press
secretary
Sean
Spicer
added
Wednesday
that
the
US
won't
"sit
by
and
not
act
on
those
actions."
Flynn's
warning
comes
as
forces
from
the
US,
British,
French
and
Australian
navies
engage
in
exercises
in
the
Persian
Gulf.
A
total
of
17
warships
from
the
four
nations
are
participating
in
the
exercises,
named
Unified
Trident,
led
by
the
UK's
amphibious
assault
ship
HMS
Ocean,
according
to
a
US
Navy
press
release.
The
drills
are
designed
to
"ensure
the
free
flow
of
commerce"
through
waterways
of
strategic
interest
to
the
entire
world,
the
US
Navy
release
said.
The
commander
of
Iran's
navy,
Rear
Adm.
Habibollah
Sayyari,
warned
the
four
navies
not
enter
Iran's
territorial
waters,
according
to
a
report
from
state-owned
Press
TV.
Iran's
Defense
Minister
Brig.
Gen.
Hossein
Dehghan
referenced
the
new
US
administration
in
telling
Iran's
independent
Mehr
News
Agency
the
allied
exercise
would
not
be
successful.
"Under
the
situation
created
in
the
wake
of
the
presidency
of
Donald
Trump,
Persian
Gulf
littoral
states
are
somehow
concerned
about
the
future
and
the
European
countries
are
interested
in
cementing
their
presence
in
the
region
and
giving
some
form
of
reassurance
to
their
allies,"
Dehghan
is
quoted
as
saying.
"These
drills
will
have
no
outcome
for
them,"
Dehghan
said.
Tensions
have
been
on
edge
around
the
Persian
Gulf
this
year.
In
early
January,
the
US
guided-missile
destroyer
USS
Mahan
fired
warning
shots
at
Iranian
boats
near
the
Strait
of
Hormuz,
the
narrow
entrance
to
the
Persian
Gulf.
The
five
Iranian
boats
came
"within
900
yards
or
so"
of
the
Mahan,
which
was
sailing
with
two
other
US
ships,
a
Pentagon
spokesman
said
at
the
time.
A
US
warship
also
fired
warning
shots
at
Iranian
vessels
in
an
incident
last
August.
