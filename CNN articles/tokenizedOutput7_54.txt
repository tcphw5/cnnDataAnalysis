(CNN)President
Donald
Trump
will
not
head
to
Milwaukee
for
a
previously
scheduled
visit
of
a
Harley-Davidson
factory
after
the
company
decided
it
wasn't
comfortable
hosting
him
amid
planned
protests,
an
administration
official
said
Tuesday.This
story
has
been
updated
to
reflect
additional
reporting.Trump
had
been
scheduled
to
tour
the
factory
Thursday
where
he
also
planned
to
sign
executive
orders
related
to
American
manufacturing.
The
visit
had
not
been
publicly
announced,
but
White
House
staffers
were
already
on
the
ground
in
Milwaukee
setting
up
for
Trump's
planned
visit
to
the
factory
on
Thursday.
White
House
spokeswoman
Stephanie
Grisham
confirmed
Trump
is
not
expected
to
go
to
Milwaukee
on
Thursday.
Harley-Davidson
issued
a
statement
Tuesday
night
saying
they
"don't
have,
nor
did
we
have,
a
scheduled
visit
from
the
President
this
week
at
any
of
our
facilities."
"We
are
proud
to
have
hosted
Presidential
visits
at
our
facilities.
Three
of
the
last
five
presidents
--
Ronald
Reagan,
George
W.
Bush
and
Bill
Clinton
--
have
visited
us
at
our
facilities.
These
visits
are
a
testament
to
the
pride
and
passion
of
our
employees
and
their
great
work
building
Harley-Davidson
motorcycles,"
said
Maripat
Blankenheim,
director
of
Harley-Davidson's
corporate
communication.
"We
look
forward
to
hosting
the
president
in
the
future."
Trump
set

make

Court
pick
Large
protests
have
been
in
the
works
in
recent
days,
particularly
in
light
of
Trump's
executive
order
issuing
an
immigration
ban.
It
was
the
threat
of
protests,
and
not
Trump's
planned
signing
of
executive
orders,
that
made
Harley-Davidson
uncomfortable,
the
official
said.
The
canceled
trip
highlighted
the
difficulties
Trump
will
continue
to
face
as
he
looks
to
implement
his
agenda
while
his
presidency
is
engulfed
in
controversy.
Trump's
decision
to
temporarily
ban
citizens
of
seven
Muslim-majority
countries
from
traveling
to
the
US
and
suspend
the
admission
of
all
refugees
has
sparked
a
wave
of
protests
nationwide
--
protests
which
now
appear
to
have
torpedoed
the
rollout
of
an
unrelated
part
of
his
policy
agenda.
The
travel
ban
was
also
met
with
widespread
condemnation
by
Democrats
and
even
some
Republicans
who
called
the
move
counterproductive
to
US
counterterrorism
efforts.
That
fiery
opposition
has
already
ramped
up
Democrats'
efforts
to
stall
the
confirmation
of
Trump's
Cabinet
nominees,
and
could
also
trickle
down
to
legislative
efforts.

Jim
Acosta
