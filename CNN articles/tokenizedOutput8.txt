Malta
(CNN)EU
leaders,
led
by
French
president
Francois
Hollande,
have
denounced
recent
attacks
on
Europe
by
Donald
Trump
as
they
met
for
a
summit
to
debate
the
future
of
the
union.CNN's

and

from
London
and

McKirdy
from
Hong
Kong.Hollande
described
Trump's
statements
as
"unacceptable",
and
German
Chancellor
Angela
Merkel
called
on
the
EU
to
press
ahead
with
its
own
plans
whatever
the
US
says.
EU
leaders
have
been
rattled
by
Trump's
comments
on
Europe
and
the
NATO
transatlantic
alliance.
He
has
voiced
his
support
for
Britain's
departure
from
the
EU,
criticized
European
refugee
policies
and
called
NATO
"obsolete".
Hollande
hit
out
at
Trump
as
he
arrived
at
the
informal
summit
on
the
future
of
the
EU
in
Malta.
"There
are
threats,
there
are
challenges.
What
is
at
stake
is
the
very
future
of
the
European
Union,"
he
said.
"It
is
unacceptable
that
there
should
be,
through
a
number
of
statements
by
the
US
President,
pressure
on
what
Europe
should
be
or
what
it
should
no
longer
be."
Merkel
called
on
fellow
EU
leaders
to
unite,
as
she
arrived
for
the
summit
in
Valletta,
Malta's
capital.
"I
already
said
that
Europe
has
its
destiny
in
its
own
hands.
And
I
believe
the
stronger
we
state
clearly
how
we
define
our
role
in
the
world,
the
better
we
can
take
care
with
our
transatlantic
relations,"
she
said.
NIC
ROBERTSON:
Europe
must
come
to
terms
with
Trump's
hostility
Austrian
Chancellor
Christian
Kern
criticized
Trump's
ban
on
travel
from
seven
Muslim-majority
countries
as
"highly
problematic."
He
blamed
some
of
the
migration
problems
on
US
intervention
in
the
Middle
East.
"There
is
no
doubt
that
America
shares
responsibility
for
the
refugee
flows
by
the
way
how
it
intervened
militarily,"
he
said,
according
to
AFP.
Concerns
about
Trump's
'decisions
and
attitudes'
The
concerns
about
Trump
continued
into
the
discussions.
Malta's
Prime
Minister
Joseph
Muscat
said
EU
leaders
expressed
concern
about
some
"decisions
and
attitudes"
of
the
Trump
administration
during
their
deliberations
at
the
summit.
"Obviously
there
was
concern
among
the
EU
28
on
some
decisions
that
are
being
taken
by
the
new
US
administration
and
some
attitudes
that
are
being
adopted
by
the
said
administration.
Nevertheless
there
was
no
sense
of
anti-Americanism.
There
was
a
sense
that
we
need
to
engage
with
the
United
States
just
the
same,
but
we
need
to
show
that
we
cannot
stay
silent
where
there
are
principles
involved."
The
President
of
the
European
Council,
Donald
Tusk,
said
protecting
Europe's
"unique"
relationship
with
the
United
States
was
still
the
"highest
political
priority"
for
not
just
the
EU,
but
for
all
of
Europe.
Speaking
at
a
press
conference
at
the
Malta
summit,
Tusk
said
that
transatlantic
cooperation
"has
until
now
been
a
key
pillar
of
the
free
world."
His
remarks
were
markedly
more
conciliatory
than
earlier
int
he
week,
when
he
called
the
Trump
administration
an
"external
threat
to
Europe."
Potential
EU
envoy
'hostile'
The
criticism
of
Trump
came
after
it
was
revealed
that
the
European
Parliament's
main
political
party
is
attempting
to
block
Trump's
expected
choice
for
US
ambassador
to
the
European
Union.
A
letter
from
the
Group
of
the
European
People's
Party,
or
EPP,
urges
the
EU
to
reject
US
businessman
Ted
Malloch,
calling
him
"hostile
and
malevolent"
and
accusing
him
of
"denigrating
the
EU."
"In
these
statements,
the
prospective
nominee
expressed
his
ambitions
'to
tame
the
bloc
like
he
brought
down
the
Soviet
Union,'
eloquently
supported
dissolution
of
the
European
Union
and
explicitly
bet
on
the
demise
of
the
common
currency
within
months,"
they
say
in
the
letter
to
the
presidents
of
the
European
Council
and
European
Commission.
"We
are
strongly
convinced
that
persons
seeing
as
their
mission
to
disrupt
or
dissolve
the
EU,
should
not
be
accredited
as
official
representatives
to
the
EU."
Opinion:
Europe
must
come
to
terms
with
Trump's
hostility
The
letter
ends
by
urging
EU
leaders
Donald
Tusk
and
Jean-Claude
Juncker
not
to
accept
Malloch
should
he
be
Trump's
pick.
Envoys
to
the
EU
must
be
approved
by
the
European
Council,
the
European
Commission
and
signed
off
by
EU
leaders.
Brexit
debate
Following
her
trip
last
week
to
Washington,
UK
Prime
Minister
Theresa
May
was
expected
to
brief
EU
leaders
on
her
meeting
with
Trump
in
which
she
received
assurances
that
he
is
fully
committed
to
NATO.
She
will
call
on
other
members
of
the
EU
to
increase
their
defense
spending.
Britain's
future
relationship
with
the
EU
is
also
on
the
agenda
in
Malta.
Britain
edged
closer
to
Brexit
this
week,
with
Parliament
voting
in
favor
of
May
triggering
Article
50
of
the
Lisbon
Treaty
--
the
formal
process
of
leaving
the
EU.
May
wants
to
invoke
Article
50
by
the
end
of
March,
firing
the
starting
gun
on
a
two-year
divorce
wrangle.
The
UK
government
has
stressed
it
wants
to
see
a
strong
and
successful
European
Union
after
Brexit.
In
Malta,
May
is
already
an
outsider,
invited
to
some
meetings
but
not
all.
She
won't
join
the
other
EU
leaders
when
they
discuss
recent
comments
by
Tusk,
the
European
Council
president,
calling
Trump
a
"threat"
to
the
European
order.
