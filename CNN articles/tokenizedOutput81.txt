(CNN)The
Food
and
Drug
Administration
urged
parents
Friday
to
not
use
Hyland's
homeopathic
teething
products
containing
belladonna,
commonly
known
as
deadly
nightshade
--
a
toxic
substance.

Homeopathic
Co.,
the
Los
Angeles-based
maker
of
Hyland's,
discontinued
its
product
October
7.
"We
discontinued
it
because
we
are
committed
to
our
moms
and
our
dads
who
choose
to
trust
us
to
put
medicines
in
their
young
infants'
mouths,
and
we
didn't
want
to
put
them
in
a
place
between
the
FDA
warning
and
us
saying
the
product
was
safe
and
having
to
decide
who
to
trust,"
said
Mary
C.
Borneman,
a
spokeswoman
for
Hyland's.
Homeopathic
teething
tablets,
which
have
been
around
since
the
early
1900s,
provide
temporary
relief
to
babies
growing
their
first
teeth.
The
FDA
originally
issued
a
safety
alert
in
2010
that
recommended
against
Hyland's
Teething
Tablets
based
on
laboratory
results
showing
that
they
contained
inconsistent
amounts
of
belladonna.
Since
then,
the
agency
has
received
more
than
400
reports
of
adverse
events
linked
to
teething
products
that
contain
belladonna.
"Most
describe
serious
adverse
events,
like
seizures,"
said
Lyndsay
Meyer,
a
spokeswoman
for
the
FDA.
"We
are
also
aware
of
reports
of
10
deaths
during
that
time
period
that
reference
homeopathic
teething
products."
Whether
these
deaths
directly
relate
to
teething
products
"has
not
yet
been
determined
and
is
currently
under
review,"
Meyer
added.
The
FDA
issued
a
second
belladonna
warning
in
September.
Though
Hyland's
discontinued
the
product
in
October,
it
continued
to
affirm
the
safety
on
its
website.
"Our
understanding
is
that
the
Food
and
Drug
Administration's
investigation
of
these
products
is
still
ongoing,"
says
the
company's
news
release
issued
at
that
time.
"The
fact
is
that
we
have
not
been
made
aware
of
any
medical
or
statistical
evidence
to
support
a
causal
link
between
homeopathic
teething
tablets
and
adverse
outcomes
at
this
point.
We
continue
to
request
any
available
information
and
statistics
from
the
FDA."
The
FDA
announcement
Friday
confirms
its
original
laboratory
assessment
of
inconsistent
amounts
of
belladonna.
"They
showed
some
limited
data
on
samples
they
tested
that
indicated
inconsistent
amounts
of
belladonna
alkaloid
at
the
nanogram
level,"
Borneman
said.
However,
the
results
"remained
within
the
documented
margin
of
safety."
"The
implication
in
the
FDA
release
is
that
consumers
who
still
have
the
product
shouldn't
use
it
because
it
might
be
unsafe,"
she
said.
The
FDA
release
noted
that
Raritan
Pharmaceuticals,
based
in
New
Jersey,
recalled
three
of
its
belladonna-containing
homeopathic
products
in
November,
yet
Hyland's
had
not
issued
a
recall.
"They
never
actually
asked
us
to
recall
it,
nor
did
we
ever
actually
refuse
to
recall
it,"
Borneman
said.
"We're
a
114-year-old
company.
Families
are
the
core
of
what
we
do.
If
we
really
thought
there
were
any
safety
issues,
we
would
definitely
take
the
next
step."
Typically,
labels
claim
that
homeopathic
teething
products
contain
"natural
ingredients,"
such
as
chamomile,
a
daisy-like
plant
recommended
by
midwivees
for
calming
babies
with
colic,
and
calcarea
carbonica,
which
is
made
from
shells
and
is,
essentially,
an
impure
version
of
calcium
carbonate
an
ingredient
used
in
antacids.
Some
also
include
belladonna.
"Since
the
body's
response
to
belladonna
in
children
under
2
years
of
age
is
unpredictable,
using
such
products
places
them
at
unnecessary
risk,"
Meyer
said.
Therefore,
the
FDA
recommends
that
parents
stop
giving
babies
any
product
that
contains
belladonna
"and
dispose
of
any
in
their
possession."
Instead
of
teething
gels
or
tablets,
the
American
Academy
of
Pediatrics
recommends
gently
rubbing
or
massaging
the
child's
gums
with
your
finger
and
giving
the
child
a
cool
(not
cold)
teething
ring
or
a
clean,
wet,
cool
washcloth
to
chew
on.
Though
they're
discontinued,
Borneman
stands
by
the
safety
of
Hyland's
Teething
Tablets:
"They
are
a
top-selling
product
and
a
consumer
favorite,
and
sadly
it
resulted
in
the
loss
of
24
jobs."
