(CNN)A
chain
of
wildfires
has
unleashed
a
catastrophe
over
wide
swaths
of
central
and
southern
Chile,
killing
at
least
11
people,
destroying
thousands
of
homes
and
consuming
an
area
about
three
times
the
size
of
New
York
City,
authorities
said.

"We
have
never
seen
anything
on
this
scale,
never
in
the
history
of
Chile,"
President
Michelle
Bachelet,
who
has
declared
a
state
of
emergency,
said
earlier
this
week.
"The
truth
is
that
the
forces
are
doing
everything
humanly
possible
and
will
continue
until
they
can
contain
and
control
the
fires."
Many
of
those
killed
are
firefighters
battling
more
than
100
separate
fires,
about
half
of
which
are
still
uncontrolled,
according
to
government
reports.
Bachelet
said
she
planned
to
meet
with
the
intelligence
heads
of
police
and
armed
forces
to
discuss
the
investigation
into
the
cause.
"Because
there
are
multiple
points
of
origin,
we
cannot
dismiss
the
possibility
that
there
might
be
an
intentional
component
here,"
she
said
Thursday
in
Santiago.
"We
are
strongly
following
this
and
have
been
investigating
it
for
some
days,
and
I
want
to
know
how
far
we've
gotten."
The
blazes,
which
began
nearly
two
weeks
ago,
have
spread
quickly
amid
historically
high
temperatures
and
an
ongoing
drought.
Nearly
240,000
hectares
(593,000
acres)
--
about
three
times
the
size
of
New
York
City
--
have
burned.
France,
Russia,
the
United
States
and
Peru
have
sent
international
help
to
combat
the
fires
following
last
week's
declaration
of
a
state
of
emergency
in
some
of
the
worst-affected
areas.
Additionally,
aid
from
Mexico
and
Colombia
was
expected
to
arrive
this
week.
The
US
Embassy
in
Chile
said
this
week
that
US
Agency
for
International
Development
was
donating
$100,000
USD
to
the
nongovernmental
organization
Caritas
Chile
for
the
purchase
and
delivery
of
firefighting
equipment,
such
as
chainsaws
and
weather
monitoring
tools.
Additionally,
the
US
Forest
Service
sent
a
four-member
emergency
response
team
of
technical
experts
to
work
with
local
authorities.
The
South
America
nation
is
vulnerable
to
earthquakes,
forest
fires,
floods,
and
volcanic
eruptions.
In
2014,
a
wildfire
swept
through
hundreds
of
homes
in
the
Pacific
coastal
city
of
Valparaiso,
leaving
at
least
12
dead,
according
to
an
official.
At
least
2,000
homes
destroyed
by
the
blaze
and
8,000
people
left
without
a
place
to
live.
