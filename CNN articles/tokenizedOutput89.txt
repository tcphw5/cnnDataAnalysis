(CNN)The
Finnish
government
has
set
an
ambitious
goal
for
residents
in
a
bid
to
benefit
their
health
--
and
their
bank
balances.See

Health
on

and
Twitter.Officials
plan
to
make
the
country
tobacco-free
by
2040,
meaning
they
want
less
than
2%
of
their
adults
to
consume
tobacco
--
in
any
form
--
by
that
deadline.
So
that's
more
than
98%
of
the
Finnish
population
saying
no
to
cigarettes,
snuff
and
other
forms
of
smokeless
tobacco,
cigars,
pipes
and
even
e-cigarettes.
As
per
the
trend
in
industralized
countries,
smoking
rates
in
Finland
have
been
on
the
decline
in
recent
decades
due
to
measures
such
as
bans
on
advertising
and
shop
displays,
and
the
creation
of
smoke-free
public
spaces.
In
2013,
16%
of
15-
to
64-year-olds
in
Finland
smoked
on
a
daily
basis,
while
nearby
in
the
UK,
19%
of
adults
were
smokers
in
2014.
But
at
the
start
of
this
year,
a
new
level
of
control
measures
came
into
force.
"The
Finnish
approach
is
revolutionary,"
said
Kaari
Paaso,
head
of
the
unit
on
harm
prevention
at
the
country's
Ministry
of
Health
and
Social
Affairs.
"We
want
to
get
rid
of
all
tobacco
products."
Experts
agree
that
the
Finnish
government
is
using
innovation
and
creativity
to
get
everyone
to
kick
the
habit.
Rather
than
targeting
one
area
at
a
time,
such
as
exposure
in
public
spaces
or
cigarette
use,
Paaso
said
his
ministry
wants
to
be
precautionary
from
every
angle.
It
doesn't
go
down
the
path
of
advocating
milder
products
that
may
do
less
harm,
such
as
e-cigarettes
or
snuff.
"It's
a
comprehensive
set
of
policies,"
he
said.
For
example,
neighboring
Sweden
has
also
seen
a
dramatic
reduction
in
the
number
of
smokers
--
just
12.7%
among
men
and
15.2%
among
women
in
2013
--
but
achieved
this
in
part
by
promoting
the
use
of
snus,
an
oral
smokeless
tobacco
product.
The
product,
along
with
all
other
forms
of
oral
tobacco,
is
banned
in
other
member
states
of
the
European
Union.
The
UK
is
also
adopting
a
harm
reduction
approach
to
reduce
the
number
of
smokers.
Instead
of
snus,
it
backs
the
use
of
e-cigarettes
to
help
people
kick
the
habit.
But
Finland
wants
rid
of
it
all.
"We
don't
want
to
fall
into
the
trap
of
other
policies
that
have
less
harmful
products,"
said
Paaso,
who
fears
that
promoting
other
products
will
result
in
a
new
addiction
for
health
officials
to
deal
with
in
the
future.
"We
want
to
phase
out
all
products."
And
that
phasing
out
has
begun.
Raising
the
cost
of
selling
tobacco
Experts
agree
that
one
of
the
strongest
policies
in
terms
of
tobacco
control
globally
has
been
taxation.
The
rising
cost
of
the
habit,
linked
to
higher
taxes,
has
meant
that
many
can
no
longer
afford
to
smoke,
and
those
who
can
smoke
provide
revenue
for
anti-smoking
campaigns
and
quitting
support
services,
to
name
a
few
options.
"The
evidence
suggests
increasing
pricing
is
the
single
most
effective
way
to
reduce
demand,"
said
Vaughan
Rees,
director
of
the
Center
for
Global
Tobacco
Control
at
the
Harvard
T.H.
Chan
School
of
Public
Health.
"In
states
where
we
see
the
highest
tax
rates,
we
see
the
lowest
prevalence,"
he
said,
highlighting
New
York
City,
where
then-Mayor
Michael
Bloomberg
introduced
city
taxes
on
top
of
state
taxes
in
2010.
Just
over
14%
of
New
Yorkers
smoked
in
2016,
according
to
the
NYC
Smoke-Free
program.
So
Finland
has
now
introduced
another
giant
financial
barrier
for
users:
It
increased
the
costs
for
vendors
selling
tobacco
products.
"There's
quite
a
high
fee
to
license
it
and
to
sell
it,"
Paaso
said.
Any
business
wanting
to
sell
tobacco
must
first
apply
and
pay
for
a
license,
a
one-off
process,
but
an
additional
fee
must
be
paid
annually
to
cover
the
costs
of
surveillance
officers
in
each
municipality
who
will
check
that
retailers
are
following
the
rules.
The
surveillance
fee
is
the
killer,
as
this
is
calculated
per
checkout
or
cashier
in
any
business
and
can
be
as
high
as
â‚¬500
($536)
annually
per
checkout.
The
fee
is
now
set
by
individual
municipalities,
not
the
state,
many
of
whom
have
decided
this
upper
limit
should
be
the
actual
cost.
"This
has
resulted
in
criticism
from
small
shop
owners
and
big
stores
...
saying
it
is
disproportionally
high
from
last
year,"
Paaso
said.
"But
that
was
not
the
idea."
The
ministry
had
hoped
the
fee
would
be
scaled
up
annually.
A
store
with
10
checkouts
could
therefore
pay
more
than
$5,000
per
year
in
addition
to
its
license
fee
to
sell
tobacco
to
the
public.
"Finland
has
come
very
far
...
and
now
they're
going
to
the
next
level,
with
innovation,"
said
Kelly
Henning,
director
of
the
public
health
program
at
Bloomberg
Philanthropies,
an
organization
working
to
promote
impactful
tobacco
control
policies,
founded
by
the
former
New
York
mayor.
Henning
highlights
that
the
World
Health
Organization's
Tobacco
Free
Initiative
has
six
steps
it
recommends
for
effective
control,
known
as
MPOWER.
The
last
letter
stands
for
"Raising
taxes
on
tobacco."
"They
have
in
place
all
MPOWER
policies
at
the
highest
possible
level,"
she
said.
Smoke-free
balconies
and
cars
Another
unique
approach
the
Scandinavian
country
implemented
this
month
was
the
ability
to
apply
for
a
ban
on
people
smoking
on
neighboring
balconies
if
their
presence
is
a
disturbance.
Housing
companies
may
now
apply
for
the
ban
if
smoke
is
seen
to
be
spreading
from
someone's
private
balcony
and
onto
other
spaces.
As
in
many
other
countries,
bans
are
in
place
in
public
areas,
but
this
new
policy
addresses
a
smoker's
private
space.
"You
can
apply
for
a
ban,"
Paaso
said.
"There
hasn't
been
big
change
...
but
these
measures
are
still
quite
new."
Finnish
residents
are
also
no
longer
allowed
to
smoke
in
private
cars
if
people
under
the
age
of
15
are
present.
This
is
not
unique,
as
other
countries
such
as
the
UK
have
imposed
bans
in
cars
when
children
are
present.
In
the
UK,
the
cutoff
age
is
higher,
at
18.
Preventing
the
appeal
to
minors
One
key
strategy
in
Finland's
approach
to
eradicate
smoking
is
reducing
the
number
of
teenagers
picking
up
the
habit
in
the
first
place,
by
reducing
its
presence
and
its
appeal.
As
a
result,
new
policies
also
limit
the
purchase
of
products
that
imitate
tobacco
or
cigarettes,
such
as
sweets
and
chocolates
shaped
as
pipes
or
cigarettes.
Though
these
products
aren't
banned,
they
face
restrictions.
For
example,
stores
where
customers
receive
discounts
through
the
use
of
a
loyalty
card
cannot
offer
such
discounts
on
such
items.
But
much
bigger
restrictions
face
the
e-cigarette
industry.
"E-cigarettes
are
sold
in
normal
shops,
but
we
have
strict
rules,"
Paaso
said.
As
of
August,
e-cigarettes
had
the
same
restrictions
in
terms
of
sales
and
public
use
as
regular
cigarettes,
such
as
age
limits,
and
they
are
no
longer
allowed
to
have
any
flavors.
"They
cannot
have
any
distinctive
taste,"
Paaso
said,
adding,
"our
approach
is
this
basic
idea
to
phase
out
all
nicotine
products."
The
use
of
flavors
in
e-cigarettes
has
been
the
subject
of
much
debate,
amid
fears
that
they
will
entice
young
people
toward
the
habit
and
act
as
a
gateway
into
smoking.
"That's
absolutely
crucial,"
said
Harvard's
Rees,
who
believes
that
e-cigarettes
can
be
a
useful
tool
to
help
people
quit
smoking
and
advocates
the
UK's
stance
on
harm
reduction.
But
his
support
ends
when
flavors
are
involved.
"We're
seeing
a
proliferation
in
flavors,
including
gummy
bear
and
candy
flavors
that
are
intrinsically
appealing
to
children."
A
global
mission?
Finland
is
not
alone
in
wanting
to
reduce
smoking
and
all
tobacco-related
habits
among
its
population.
Henning
and
Rees
highlight
Australia,
where
plain
packaging
on
cigarette
boxes
in
combination
with
taxation
has
helped
bring
numbers
down
rapidly.
In
2014-15,
just
14.7%
of
adults
18
or
over
smoked
daily
--
less
than
than
Finland
--
compared
with
more
than
16%
in
2011-12.
"They
increased
the
price
dramatically,
and
we're
now
seeing
a
benefit,"
Rees
said.
On
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum
lies
China.
After
a
surge
in
demand
for
tobacco
products
in
recent
years
as
more
people
took
up
smoking,
three
cities
have
banned
smoking
indoors
in
public
places,
including
the
capital,
Beijing.
"Tobacco-related
deaths
are
rising
because
male
smoking
rates
are
so
high,"
Henning
said.
More
than
1.3
million
people
die
each
year
of
tobacco-related
disease
in
China,
according
to
the
Tobacco
Atlas,
linked
to
the
fact
that
more
than
45%
of
men
are
smokers.
"We're
optimistic
that
these
cities
are
going
to
lead
the
way."
On
a
global
level,
the
WHO
set
a
goal
to
reduce
tobacco
use
among
people
over
the
age
of
15
by
30%
by
2025,
to
fit
in
line
with
goals
to
reduce
rates
of
non-communicable
disease,
like
cancer,
as
a
result.
But
Finland
remains
a
pioneer,
the
first
country
to
set
a
goal
to
end
the
problem
in
its
entirety.
Experts,
as
well
as
the
government,
believe
they
can
make
it
happen.
"Governments
should
set
themselves
that
goal
of
achieving
exactly
that,"
Rees
said.
But
he
acknowledges
that
not
all
countries
would
necessarily
be
able
to
achieve
it,
with
culture
playing
a
key
role.
"Finland,
having
a
much
more
control
over
a
relatively
homogenous
population,
can
realistically
set
that
goal."
And
Henning
agrees
that
simply
setting
a
target
can
make
a
difference.
"It's
a
long
shot,"
she
said.
"But
Finland
believes
it's
achievable."
