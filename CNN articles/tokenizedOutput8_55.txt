(CNN)A
Chinese
billionaire
with
Canadian
citizenship
has
been
seized
from
his
apartment
at
the
Four
Seasons
hotel
in
Hong
Kong
and
taken
to
mainland
China,
a
source
familiar
with
the
situation
told
CNN
Wednesday.CNN's
Esther
Pang,
Felicia
Wong,
Yuli
Yang,
Vivian
Kam
and
Zahra
Ullah
contributed

this
reportHong
Kong
police
said
they
were
investigating
the
disappearance
of
Xiao
Jianhua,
who
was
reported
missing
Friday.
Police
added
that
they
had
received
a
request
Saturday
from
a
family
member
to
drop
the
case.
"We
are
still
investigating
and
have
reached
out
to
the
mainland
authorities
concerned,"
the
statement
sent
to
CNN
Tuesday
said.
Xiao
is
one
of
China's
richest
men
and
controls
the
Tomorrow
Group,
a
massive
holding
company
with
stakes
in
banks,
insurers
and
property
developers.
According
to
Hurun,
which
analyzes
Chinese
wealth,
Xiao
is
46
and
has
a
net
worth
of
$6
billion.
Similar
pattern?
Xiao's
disappearance
adds
to
fears
that
freedoms
guaranteed
under
the
"one
country,
two
systems"
policy
agreed
to
as
part
of
Britain's
1997
handover
of
Hong
Kong
are
being
eroded
as
Beijing
asserts
more
control
over
the
city.
His
case
has
drawn
comparisons
with
Lee
Bo,
a
bookseller
and
British
passport
holder
that
disappeared
from
Hong
Kong
in
late
2015
and
later
turned
up
in
Chinese
custody.
Lee's
removal,
which
came
after
the
disappearance
of
four
of
his
colleagues,
sparked
outrage
in
Hong
Kong
and
internationally
over
fears
he
was
taken
against
his
will
by
Chinese
law
enforcement
agents,
who
aren't
permitted
to
act
in
the
self-governing
city.
One
of
the
booksellers,
Swedish
citizen
Gui
Minhai,
remains
in
detention
15
months
after
he
was
taken
from
Thailand.

Front-page
denial
The
person
familiar
with
the
situation
told
CNN
that
there
was
a
small
scuffle
between
two
dozen
security
officials
and
Xiao's
own
security
detail,
which
usually
numbers
about
eight
bodyguards
per
shift.
The
source,
who
wanted
to
remain
anonymous
because
of
the
politically
sensitive
nature
of
the
case,
said
Xiao
had
close
connections
to
some
of
China's
most
powerful
families.
In
a
front-page
ad
published
in
Hong
Kong's
Mingpao
newpaper
Wednesday,
Xiao
appeared
to
deny
he
had
been
kidnapped.
The
statement
in
Chinese,
which
had
Xiao's
name
printed
at
the
bottom,
said
that
he
was
"recuperating
overseas"
and
hoped
to
meet
with
media
once
he
had
recovered.
"I'm
a
patriotic
overseas
Chinese
and
I've
always
loved
the
party
and
the
country,"
it
said.
The
statement
added
that
he
was
a
Canadian
citizen
entitled
to
consular
assistance
and
a
permanent
Hong
Kong
resident.
Mingpao
said
they
couldn't
disclose
who
bought
the
unusual
ad,
which
according
to
the
newspaper's
advertising
rate
card
would
have
cost
$36,500.
Other
high-profile
businesspeople
detained
in
China
have
been
pressed
to
release
messages
insisting
that
everything
is
fine.
The
newspaper
statement
was
similar
to
a
post
on
the
Tomorrow
Group's
WeChat
account
--
a
social
network
and
messaging
app
that's
massively
popular
in
China.
The
post
has
since
been
deleted.
The
Four
Seasons,
which
occupies
a
45-story
skyscraper
that
commands
spectacular
views
of
Hong
Kong's
harbor,
said
it
was
cooperating
with
the
police
investigation
but
declined
to
comment
further.
The
Canadian
Consulate
said
it
was
aware
of
the
reports
and
officials
were
"in
contact
with
the
authorities
to
gather
additional
information
and
provide
assistance."
"In
order
to
protect
the
privacy
of
the
individual
concerned,
further
details
on
this
case
cannot
be
released."
China's
Ministry
of
Foreign
Affairs
and
Public
Security
Ministry
didn't
respond
to
a
request
for
comment.
Who
is
he?
Born
in
China,
Xiao
also
held
a
diplomatic
passport
from
Antigua
and
Barbuda,
where
he
was
an
ambassador
at
large,
according
to
a
statement
on
the
Antigua
government
website.
The
country's
foreign
ministry
didn't
immediately
respond
to
a
request
for
comment.
According
to
the
Financial
Times,
Xiao
was
a
financier
with
links
to
the
family
of
Chinese
President
Xi
Jinping.
He
was
one
of
a
number
of
Chinese
tycoons
who
had
moved
to
Hong
Kong
and
taken
up
residence
in
private
apartments
at
the
5-star
Four
Seasons
hotel
during
Xi's
crackdown
on
corporate
excess,
the
paper
said.
A
2014
profile
in
the
New
York
Times
said
Xiao
was
often
surrounded
by
aides
and
retained
a
number
of
female
body
guards
"who
even
wipe
the
sweat
from
his
brow."
Born
in
a
poor
mountain
village,
Xiao
passed
the
highly
competitive
college
entrance
exam
at
14
and
attended
Peking
University,
China's
most
prestigious,
it
added.
