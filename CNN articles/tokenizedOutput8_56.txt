The
superstar
singer
posted
a
photo
with
her
baby
bump
on
Instagram
Wednesday
to
announce
the
joyful
news.
"We

Beyoncé
and
her
superstar
husband
Jay
Z
are
parents
to
five-year-old
daughter,
Blue
Ivy.
The
couple
married
in
2008.
The
family's
news
set
social
media
on
fire
with
the
Beyhive
(as
her
diehard
fans
are
known)
buzzing
about
the
new
heir
and
spare.
Twitter
reported
more
than
half
a
million
tweets
about
Beyoncé
in
the
first
hour
after
her
big
reveal.
Beyoncé
has
frequently
been
the
subject
of
pregnancy
rumors.
In
2011,
she
announced
the
impending
birth
of
their
first
child
by
revealing
her
baby
bump
at
the
end
of
a
performance
at
the
MTV
Video
Music
Awards.
Fans
had
been
tipped
off
earlier
in
the
evening
when
she
was
seen
cradling
her
baby
bump
on
the
VMAs
red
carpet.
Beyoncé
is
nominated
for
nine
2017
Grammy
Awards
and
is
expected
to
attend
the
ceremony
on
February
12.
She
is
also
scheduled
to
headline
the
Coachella
music
festival
in
April.
