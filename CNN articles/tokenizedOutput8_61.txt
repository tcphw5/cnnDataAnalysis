(CNN)Amid
the
chaos
and
confusion
of
President
Donald
Trump's
new
executive
order
on
immigration
and
refugees,
sources
tell
CNN
that
White
House
policy
director
Stephen
Miller
spoke
with
officials
of
the
State
Department,
Customs
and
Border
Patrol,
Department
of
Homeland
Security
and
others
to
tell
them
that
the
President
is
deeply
committed
to
the
executive
order
and
the
public
is
firmly
behind
it
--
urging
them
not
to
get
distracted
by
what
he
described
as
hysterical
voices
on
TV.CNN's
Eric
Bradner,
Evan
Perez,
Pamela
Brown,
Kevin
Liptak,
Jeremy
Diamond
and
Steve
Almasy
contributed
to
this
report.
Judge
halts
implementation
of
Trump
immigration
order
Miller
also
noted
on
Saturday
that
Trump
administration
officials
are
discussing
the
possibility
of
asking
foreign
visitors
to
disclose
all
websites
and
social
media
sites
they
visit,
and
to
share
the
contacts
in
their
cell
phones.
If
the
foreign
visitor
declines
to
share
such
information,
he
or
she
could
be
denied
entry.
Sources
told
CNN
that
the
idea
is
just
in
the
preliminary
discussion
level.
The
social
media
posts
calling
for
jihad
by
San
Bernardino
terrorist
Tashfeen
Malik
--
made
under
a
pseudonym
and
with
strict
privacy
settings
--
are
part
of
this
discussion.
How
such
a
policy
would
be
implemented
remains
under
discussion.
More
protests
against
Trump's
immigration
order
Miller
praised
the
State
Department
on
Saturday,
sources
tell
CNN,
but
argued
that
the
government
needs
to
do
better
job
of
making
sure
the
people
who
come
into
the
US
embrace
American
values.
White
House
press
secretary
Sean
Spicer
did
not
respond
to
a
request
for
comment.
Already,
Politico
reported
in
December,
the
US
government
had
quietly
begun
asking
that
foreign
visitors
provide
their
social
media
accounts
voluntarily.
The
Obama
administration
had
previously
approved
asking
for
much
more
information
from
people
on
terror
watch
lists,
The
Intercept
reported
in
2014.
Trump's
executive
order
bars
citizens
of
seven
Muslim-majority
countries
from
entering
the
United
States
for
the
next
90
days
and
suspends
the
admission
of
all
refugees
for
120
days.
Trump's
unilateral
moves,
which
have
drawn
the
ire
of
human
rights
groups
and
prompted
protests
at
US
airports,
reflect
the
President's
desire
to
quickly
make
good
on
his
campaign
promises.
But
they
also
encapsulate
the
pitfalls
of
an
administration
largely
operated
by
officials
with
scant
federal
experience.
It
wasn't
until
Friday
--
the
day
Trump
signed
the
order
banning
travel
from
seven
Muslim-majority
countries
for
90
days
and
suspending
all
refugee
admission
for
120
days
--
that
career
homeland
security
staff
were
allowed
to
see
the
final
details
of
the
order,
a
person
familiar
with
the
matter
said.
The
result
was
widespread
confusion
across
the
country
on
Saturday
as
airports
struggled
to
adjust
to
the
new
directives.
In
New
York,
two
Iraqi
nationals
sued
the
federal
government
after
they
were
detained
at
John
F.
Kennedy
International
Airport,
and
10
others
were
detained
as
well.
Trump
on
Sunday
defended
his
recent
executive
order
on
extreme
vetting,
saying
in
a
statement:
"We
will
continue
to
show
compassion
to
those
fleeing
oppression,
but
we
will
do
while
protecting
our
own
citizens
and
voters."
He
added:
"This
is
not
a
Muslim
ban,
as
the
media
is
falsely
reporting.
This
is
not
about
religion
--
this
is
about
terror
and
keeping
our
country
safe."
He
said
his
first
priority
"will
always
be
to
protect
and
serve
our
country,
but
as
President
I
will
find
ways
to
help
all
of
those
who
are
suffering."
