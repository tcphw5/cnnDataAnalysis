(CNN)You've
just
finished
a
big
meal,
and
you're
stuffed.
You're
thinking
of
taking
a
walk
or
even
a
stretch
before
clearing
the
table,
but
the
thought
of
just
getting
out
of
your
chair
seems
like
a
challenge.

journalist.The
idea
of
taking
a
snooze
on
the
couch
seems
more
and
more
appealing.
Sounds
familiar?
There's
a
name
for
it:
It's
called
postprandial
somnolence
--
commonly
referred
to
as
"food
coma."
The
phenomenon
refers
to
the
tired,
sleepy
feeling
that
many
of
us
experience
after
eating
a
big
meal.
And
the
causes
are
based
on
different
theories,
some
more
plausible
than
others.
Blood
flow
shifts
According
to
David
Levitsky,
professor
of
nutrition
and
psychology
at
Cornell
University,
the
most
likely
explanation
for
food
comas
has
to
do
with
changes
in
circulation.
When
food
enters
your
stomach
and
activates
the
gastrointestinal
tract,
"blood
flow
shifts
from
the
muscles
and
brain
into
the
stomach
and
intestines,"
he
explained.
"And
when
blood
volume
goes
down
in
the
brain,
we
get
woozy
and
tired.
It's
why
I
have
to
make
my
lectures
extremely
exciting:
They're
right
after
lunch."
These
blood
shifts
occur
because
eating
a
meal
activates
our
parasympathetic
nervous
system,
the
part
of
our
nervous
system
that
triggers
digestion
and
absorption
of
food.
It's
been
dubbed
the
"rest
and
digest
system,"
as
its
aim
is
to
conserve
energy
as
it
slows
heart
rate
and
increases
intestinal
activity,
preparing
the
body
to
assimilate
a
meal's
nutrients.
On
the
flip
side,
our
sympathetic
nervous
system
takes
on
the
opposite
role:
It's
triggered
in
response
to
a
threat
or
danger
and
induces
a
"fight
or
flight"
response,
resulting
in
increased
heart
rate
and
increased
blood
flow
to
the
brain.
Bigger
meals
have
more
effects
You're
not
at
risk
of
falling
into
a
food
coma
if
you're
just
having
a
few
bites
of
a
snack,
though.
"It's
got
to
be
a
large
meal,"
Levitsky
said.
"The
parasympathetic
nervous
system
is
activated
when
you
eat,
but
(the
extent
to
which
it
induces
sleepiness)
depends
on
the
magnitude
of
the
meal."
How
does
it
work?
It
has
to
do
with
gastric
distention,
or
the
stretching
of
the
stomach
after
we
eat
a
large
amount
of
food.
The
bigger
the
meal,
the
more
distention
and
the
greater
the
effects.
"If
you
have
a
large
meal,
the
(degree
of)
gastric
distention
and
hormonal
stimulation
that
occurs
will
make
you
sleepier
than
if
you
had
a
bowl
of
soup,"
explained
Dr.
William
Orr,
a
clinical
professor
of
medicine
at
the
University
of
Oklahoma
Health
Sciences
Center
who
has
published
studies
on
the
topic.
Also,
a
liquid
meal
seems
to
make
us
less
tired
than
a
solid
meal.
"Our
study
found
that
in
contrast
to
a
liquid
meal,
a
solid
meal
creates
more
sleepiness
when
compared
to
an
equivalent
volume
of
water,"
Orr
said.
Part
of
the
reason
is
that
liquids
and
solids
stimulate
different
parts
of
the
stomach
and
have
different
feedback
stimuli
to
the
brain,
according
to
Orr.
Liquids
are
primarily
handled
in
the
upper
part
of
the
stomach,
known
as
the
fundus,
whereas
solids
are
primarily
processed
in
the
antrum,
or
the
lower
part.
It's
more
likely
that
the
antrum
has
neural
connections
in
the
brain
that
are
more
likely
to
induce
sleepiness,
he
said.
Hormone
theories:
CCK,
serotonin
and
tryptophan
CCK
is
an
intestinal
hormone
that
rises
in
the
blood
after
you
eat,
a
fact
well-known
and
documented
in
rats,
according
to
Levitsky.
And
in
rats,
injections
of
CCK
at
very
high
doses
put
them
to
sleep.
"But
if
you
infuse
CCK
through
a
catheter
until
it
reaches
the
concentrations
normally
seen
after
eating
a
meal,
rats
don't
necessarily
get
sleepy,"
Levitsky
said.
The
bottom
line:
CCK
may
not
play
a
meaningful
role
in
post-meal
fatigue
after
all.
A
similar
case
can
be
made
for
serotonin,
a
neurotransmitter
that
is
produced
from
the
amino
acid
tryptophan
and
is
responsible
for
feelings
of
relaxation
and
sleepiness.
It's
true
that
after
we
eat,
the
amount
of
tryptophan
in
the
blood
increases,
especially
if
we
eat
a
lot
of
carbohydrates
--
and
this
would
theoretically
lead
to
greater
production
of
serotonin
in
the
brain.
However,
the
amount
of
tryptophan
that
increases
after
we
eat
is
not
great
enough
to
raise
brain
serotonin
levels.
"If
you
infuse
serotonin
directly
into
the
brain,
it
will
make
you
go
to
sleep,
but
like
CCK,
the
concentration
necessary
to
produce
this
effect
is
supraphysiological,"
Levitsky
said.
"The
direction
of
the
theory
is
correct,
but
the
quantification
is
not."
Protein,
fat
and
circadian
rhythms
Protein
delays
gastric
dumping,
which
means
food,
and
its
surrounding
supply
of
blood,
tends
to
stay
in
the
stomach
longer.
"It
is
theoretically
possible
that
after
eating
a
large
(protein-rich)
meal,
you
may
feel
more
tired,"
Levitsky
said.
Indeed,
a
recent
study
involving
fruit
flies
found
that
the
more
protein
the
flies
consumed,
the
longer
they
slept.
A
similar
case
can
be
made
for
fat,
which
also
takes
longer
to
digest
--
though
when
eaten
with
carbs,
small
amounts
of
protein
or
fat
can
help
stave
off
sleepiness
by
slowing
the
rise
in
blood
sugar
after
a
meal,
which
can
help
prevent
blood
sugar
spikes
and
crashes.
Circadian
rhythms
contribute
to
food
comas,
too.
In
our
bodies,
there
is
a
normal
decrease
in
arousal
that
occurs
in
the
early
to
mid-afternoon,
a
biological
phenomenon
that
contributes
to
sleepiness
and
is
compounded
by
eating
a
meal.
"Around
1
or
1:30
p.m.
is
right
about
when
that
dip
occurs,
where
we
are
a
little
more
drowsy,"
Orr
explained,
though
that
time
can
vary
based
on
when
you
wake
up.
"Even
if
you
don't
eat
lunch,
you
would
still
get
sleepy
due
to
the
circadian
rhythm.
But
when
we
eat
at
this
time,
it's
a
double
whammy."
There's
also
a
dip
in
the
evening
--
due
largely
to
the
normal
circadian
decrease
in
body
temperature
that
occurs
at
this
time
--
and
a
large
dinner
would
compound
the
food
coma
effect.
But
for
most,
feeling
sleepy
when
it's
closer
to
bedtime
serves
us
better
than
becoming
drowsy
earlier
in
the
day.
"In
the
mid-afternoon,
you're
occupied
with
the
tasks
of
daily
living,
and
getting
very
sleepy
does
not
help!"
Orr
said.
Preventing
a
food
coma
Though
a
food
coma
may
seem
inevitable
at
times,
there
are
some
things
you
can
do
that
may
help:
Eat
small
meals.
The
bigger
the
meal,
the
greater
the
chance
you'll
be
drowsy.
"We
have
to
consciously
put
small
amounts
of
food
on
our
plates,"
says
Levitsky.
At
lunchtime,
small
portions
are
especially
important,
because
the
lunchtime
dip
in
arousal
compounds
the
effects.
"If
I
want
to
avoid
postprandial
sleepiness,
I
will
have
a
light
lunch,
because
I
know
no
matter
what,
at
1
or
2
p.m.,
I
will
be
sleepy,
even
if
I
don't
eat
anything,"
Orr
said.
Have
an
early
lunch.
"If
you
eat
at
1
p.m.,
that's
right
at
the
time
of
the
endogenous
circadian
dip,"
Orr
said.
It's
better
to
eat
an
earlier
lunch
about
11:45
a.m.
rather
than
a
later
lunch
at,
say,
1
or
1:30,
right
when
that
dip
occurs.Choose
liquids
over
solids.
That
doesn't
mean
lunch
has
to
be
limited
to
smoothies,
though
occasionally
they're
fine
as
a
mini
meal.
"If
you
have
a
salad
or
a
bowl
of
soup
as
opposed
to
a
hamburger
--
something
with
more
of
a
liquid
consistency,
with
a
higher
water
content
--
that's
better,"
Orr
said.
Opt
for
carbs
that
are
low
on
the
glycemic
index
over
ones
that
are
high.
Low-GI
carbs
include
whole
wheat
bread,
oatmeal,
beans,
peas,
most
fruits
and
non-starchy
vegetables.
Limit
white
bread,
white
rice,
bagels,
pretzels
and
crackers.Grab
a
cup
of
coffee.
"You
can
counter
the
effects
of
sleepiness
after
a
meal
by
consuming
caffeine,"
Levitsky
said.
A
cup
of
coffee
or
cappuccino
should
suffice.
Though
caffeine
can
serve
as
a
helpful
stimulant,
too
much
can
lead
to
restlessness
and
can
interfere
with
sleep
later
on.
Skip
the
wine
and
martinis.
"Alcohol
is
a
sedative,
so
this
just
adds
to
the
drowsiness,"
Orr
explained.
If
you
enjoy
a
drink
with
a
meal,
choose
dinnertime
over
lunch,
and
limit
yourself
to
one
beverage.
