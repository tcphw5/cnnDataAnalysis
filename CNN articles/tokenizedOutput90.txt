(CNN)To
grow
human
organs
within
animal
bodies
has
long
been
the
dream
of
scientists
wanting
to
provide
transplantable
hearts,
lungs,
kidneys
and
other
organs
for
patients
in
need.
A
glimpse
of
possible
success
in
this
elusive
goal
was
seen
Thursday.See
the
latest
news
and
share
your
comments
with
CNN
Health
on
Facebook
and
Twitter.Using
stem
cell
technologies,
researchers
generated
human
cells
and
human
tissues
in
the
embryos
of
pigs
and
cattle.
Their
research
appeared
in
the
journal
Cell.
Despite
this
milestone,
integrating
cells
from
human
and
animal
species
is
proving
difficult,
and
developing
human
organs
remains
at
a
considerable
distance,
said
Dr.
Jun
Wu,
a
staff
scientist
in
the
gene
expression
laboratory
at
the
Salk
Institute
and
first
author
of
the
research.
"Species
evolve
independently,
and
many
factors
dictating
the
developmental
programs
might
have
diverged,
which
makes
it
difficult
to
blend
cells
from
one
species
to
a
developing
embryo
from
another,"
Wu
said.
"The
larger
the
evolutionary
distance,
the
more
difficult
for
them
to
mix."
Or
as
senior
author
Juan
Carlos
Izpisua
Belmonte,
a
professor
in
Salk's
gene
expression
laboratory,
sees
it,
"To
try
to
imitate
nature
is
not
that
easy."
Building
block
experiments
The
project
began
with
the
research
team
attempting
to
prove
that
it
could
grow
one
animal's
organ
cells
within
a
different
species
of
animal.
This
is
known
as
a
chimera
--
specifically
an
interspecies
chimera,
an
organism
containing
cells
from
two
or
more
species.
They
began
with
two
closely
related
species:
rats
and
mice.
To
create
a
rat-mouse
chimera,
the
scientists
began
by
creating
a
mouse
embryo
without
a
pancreas.
Similar
work
had
been
done
before
by
other
scientists,
notably
Hiromitsu
Nakauchi,
now
at
Stanford,
who
bred
mutant
mice
that
lacked
a
pancreas
and
then
grew
a
rat
pancreas
inside
a
mouse.
In
the
current
study,
Belmonte,
Wu
and
their
colleagues
used
gene-editing
techniques
known
as
CRISPR/Cas9
to
generate
mice
embryos
lacking
a
pancreas.
Then
they
inserted
rat
stem
cells
that
contained
a
gene
for
the
pancreas
into
these
mutant
embryos.
Once
implanted,
the
stem
cells
developed
into
a
rat
pancreas
within
a
mouse
embryo
that
ultimately
(and
importantly)
grew
into
a
healthy
mouse
with
a
normal
lifespan.
Taking
their
idea
a
few
steps
further,
the
researchers
used
the
same
method
to
develop
rat
eyes
and
rat
hearts
within
mice
embryos.
"We
demonstrated
the
robustness
of
this
system,"
Wu
said.
By
"genetically
disabling"
the
mouse
host,
they
proved
it
was
possible
to
generate
rat
organs
within
a
host
species.
Unexpectedly
to
the
researchers,
the
mice
delivered
bonus
organs
after
the
injection
of
rat
stem
cells:
gallbladders,
which
are
present
in
mice
but
not
in
rats.
"This
suggests
that
rats
lack
a
gallbladder
not
because
of
an
inherent
genetic
deficiency
of
rat
cells,"
Wu
said.
Instead,
"embryonic
niches"
may
be
orchestrating
the
tissues
and
organs
that
develop
and
grow
within
each
animal
species.
After
the
rat-mice
experiments,
the
team
turned
its
focus
to
human
stem
cells.
Small
but
significant
They
began
by
generating
different
types
of
human
induced
pluripotent
stem
cells
--
when
adult
cells
are
turned
back
into
stem
cells
--
and
inserting
them
into
pig
embryos.
Pigs
were
used
because
both
the
size
and
the
development
time
for
their
organs
are
more
similar
to
our
own
than,
say,
rats.
Next,
the
team
members
implanted
these
embryos
into
sows.
To
test
the
safety
and
effectiveness
of
their
work,
they
stopped
the
experiment
at
four
weeks.
Human
cells
within
some
of
the
embryos
had
begun
to
specialize
and
turn
into
tissue
precursors,
they
discovered.
However,
the
success
rate
and
level
of
human
stem
cell
contributions
in
pigs
was
much
lower
than
with
the
rat-mouse
chimeras.
Wu
cautioned
that
the
research
is
in
its
very
early
stages,
and
with
many
challenges
ahead,
the
development
of
human
organs
within
animals
may
not
be
possible
for
some
time.
Though
the
experiment
with
human
stem
cells
was
interrupted
at
28
days,
it
remains
the
first
reported
case
in
which
human
stem
cells
have
begun
to
grow
within
another
species.
So
it
is
a
small
but
significant
step
toward
the
ultimate
goal
of
growing
human
organs
in
animals,
said
Insoo
Hyun,
an
associate
professor
of
bioethics
and
philosophy
at
Case
Western
Reserve
University.
"They
just
wanted
to
see
if
the
cells
would
survive
during
gestation,
and
they
did,
and
they
kind
of
migrated
here
and
there
to
various
sites,
except
the
brain,
which
is
interesting,"
said
Hyun,
who
was
not
involved
in
the
research.
Hyun,
who
worked
on
developing
international
guidelines
for
the
International
Society
for
Stem
Cell
Research,
said
the
Salk
Institute
researchers
appear
to
be
staying
within
international
ethical
boundaries.
"The
next
step
would
be
then
to
see
if
they
can
get
better
at
localizing
where
the
human
cells
develop
and,
ideally,
getting
to
organ
genesis,"
he
noted.
Ethical
concerns
"The
interesting
thing
is,
it
was
not
funded
by
American
taxpayer
money,"
Hyun
said,
at
least
not
directly.
The
primary
funding
came
from
private
Spanish
sources.
One
reason
for
this
is
the
US
National
Institutes
of
Health
examined
chimera
science
in
a
2015
workshop
and
"accompanied
that
with
a
pause"
on
funding
of
a
"very
narrow
subset
of
animal
human
chimera
research,"
said
Carrie
D.
Wolinetz,
the
institutes'
associate
director
for
science
policy.
This
subset
consists
of
scientists
introducing
human
cells
into
animal
embryos
at
a
very
early
stage.
"There
has
been
the
use
of
human-animal
chimeras
in
biomedical
research
for
a
very
long
time.
We've
introduced
human
cells
into
animal
models
to
create
models
of
human
diseases
and
used
them
as
research
tools
for
decades
now,"
Wolinetz
said.
"But
over
time,
what
we've
seen
--
as
stem
cell
technology
has
advanced
and
as
gene
editing
technology
has
advanced
--
we've
seen
the
ability
to
create
more
sophisticated
animal-human
chimeras
at
a
much
earlier
stage
of
embryonic
development,"
she
said.
The
reason,
then,
the
National
Institutes
of
Health
suspended
funding
was
over
ethical
concerns.
The
chimeras
used
in
biomedical
research
have
been
created,
typically,
by
putting
the
human
cells
in
at
a
later
stage
of
development:
at
the
fetal
stage
or
even
after
birth.
At
these
stages,
scientists
have
a
lot
more
control
in
that
the
cells
stay
where
they
are
put,
and
they
don't
"drift
all
over"
the
animal's
body,
explained
Wolinetz.
In
these
new
experiments,
human
cells
are
being
introduced
at
a
much
earlier
stage
of
development,
when
the
cells
are
still
sorting
themselves
out
within
the
embryo.
"In
particular,
people
were
concerned
about
human
cells
populating
the
brain
of
the
animal
or
the
germline
of
the
animal,"
Wolinetz
said.
In
the
first
case,
the
animal
might
be
humanized;
in
the
second
case,
the
animal
might
pass
human
genes
on
to
its
offspring.
As
Hyun
frames
it,
the
ethical
question
is
this:
"If
you
up
the
biological
contribution
of
the
human
stem
cells,
are
you
also
somehow
turning
them
morally
into
a
human-like
thing
with
human
rights?"
He
noted,
though,
"It's
so
difficult
to
know
how
you
would
actually
address
that."
It's
not
measurable.
"I
would
argue,
as
long
as
you
are
avoiding
the
brain,
or
there's
not
a
significant
change
to
the
brain,
of
structure
and
possible
functioning,
then
I
don't
think
you
even
need
to
go
down
that
philosophical
path,"
he
said.
Though
as
a
philosopher,
it
might
be
"fun"
for
him,
it's
not
a
wise
or
practical
thing
to
do
for
policy.
Instead,
Hyun
said,
you
want
to
stick
with
measurable
criteria
such
as
seeing
a
drop
in
animal
function
from
the
beginning
of
an
experiment
to
the
end.
"The
emphasis
should
still
remain
on
animal
welfare,"
he
said,
as
it
is
currently
for
any
kind
of
animal
research.
Meanwhile,
Wolinetz
said
the
National
Institutes
of
Health
is
hoping
to
finalize
its
policy
on
chimera
research
very
soon
in
order
to
get
back
into
the
business
of
funding
appropriate
projects.
"We
would
like
to
make
sure
exciting
research
can
go
forward,"
she
said,
"but
also
make
sure
that
we've
got
an
appropriate
oversight
system
so
we
can
make
sure
it's
proceeding
responsibly."
