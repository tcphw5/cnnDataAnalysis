(CNN)President
Donald
Trump
and
Russian
President
Vladimir
Putin
are
scheduled
to
speak
on
the
phone
Saturday
in
their
first
conversation
since
Trump
took
office,
with
Vice
President
Mike
Pence
joining
the
call.Trump
has
vowed
to
have
better
relations
with
Russia
than
his
predecessor.
This
month,
he
suggested
he
would
lift
sanctions
imposed
by
the
Obama
administration
if
the
Kremlin
helps
the
US
battle
terrorists.
In
his
new
year's
message,
Putin
congratulated
Trump
and
expressed
hope
their
two
countries
would
be
able
to
"take
their
interaction
in
the
international
arena
to
a
whole
new
level."
"Major
global
and
regional
challenges
that
our
countries
have
confronted
in
recent
years
clearly
confirm
that
Russia-US
relations
are
an
important
factor
in
ensuring
stability
and
security
in
the
modern
world,"
Putin
said.
Russian
Foreign
Minister
Sergey
Lavrov
this
week
called
for
the
"re-establishment
of
normal
relations"
between
Russia
and
the
United
States
under
the
Trump
administration.
"Following
the
difficult
relations
we
had
under
Barack
Obama,
President
Putin
is
ready
to
meet
in
the
interests
of
global
security
and
stability,"
Lavrov
said.

Tensions
between
the
US
and
Russia
are
at
their
highest
in
years,
after
the
Obama
administration
accused
the
Kremlin
of
interfering
in
the
2016
election,
imposing
sanctions
and
ejecting
diplomats.
Trump
has
been
accused
by
his
critics
of
being
too
close
to
Russia,
and
both
he
and
Obama
were
briefed
on
an
unverified
dossier
containing
allegations
that
Russian
operatives
possessed
compromising
information
on
Trump.
Some
4,000
US
soldiers
have
also
been
deployed
to
eastern
Europe
as
part
of
troop
rotations
the
Pentagon
said
are
intended
to
bolster
ties
with
NATO
allies
and
send
a
message
to
Russia.
There
is
therefore
great
scope
for
Trump
to
improve
relations
between
Washington
and
the
Kremlin,
as
he
has
expressed
a
desire
to
do.
This
week,
however,
UK
Prime
Minister
Theresa
May
advised
caution
when
dealing
with
Russia,
ahead
of
her
meeting
Friday
with
Trump.
"With
President
Putin,
my
advice
is
to
engage,
but
beware,"
she
said.
"We
should
engage
with
Russia
from
a
position
of
strength
and
build
the
relationship,
systems,
and
processes
that
make
cooperation
more
likely
than
conflict."
