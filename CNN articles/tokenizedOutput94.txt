(CNN)Mexican
President
Enrique
Peña
Nieto
on
Thursday
canceled
a
meeting
with
US
President
Donald
Trump
that
had
been
set
for
next
week
after
renewed
tensions
erupted
over
Trump's
plan
to
build
a
wall
on
the
border.The
U.S.
has
a
60
billion
dollar
trade
deficit
with
Mexico.
It
has
been
a
one-sided
deal
from
the
beginning
of
NAFTA
with
massive
numbers...of
jobs
and
companies
lost.
If
Mexico
is
unwilling
to
pay
for
the
badly
needed
wall,
then
it
would
be
better
to
cancel
the
upcoming
meeting.CNN's
Mary
Kay
Mallonee
contributed
to
this
report.
"This
morning
we
have
informed
the
White
House
that
I
will
not
attend
the
meeting
scheduled
for
next
Tuesday
with
the
POTUS,"
Peña
Nieto
tweeted.
Earlier
Thursday
morning,
Trump
had
tweeted
that
it
would
be
better
to
skip
the
meeting
if
Peña
Nieto
continued
to
insist
Mexico
would
not
pay
for
the
wall
--
something
the
Mexican
leader
had
said
as
recently
as
Wednesday
evening.
"If
Mexico
is
unwilling
to
pay
for
the
badly
needed
wall,
then
it
would
be
better
to
cancel
the
upcoming
meeting,"
Trump
tweeted
and
in
an
earlier
tweet
he
noted
the
US's
trade
deficit
with
Mexico
and
what
he
said
were
the
American
job
losses
caused
by
NAFTA.
Trump
spoke
about
the
cancellation
during
remarks
at
a
gathering
of
congressional
Republicans
in
Philadelphia.
Trump
said
that
he
and
the
Mexican
president
had
mutually
agreed
to
scrap
their
planned
get
together,
and
he
repeated
his
position
that
the
US
won't
fund
the
wall.
"Unless
Mexico
will
treat
the
US
fairly,
with
respect,
such
a
meeting
is
fruitless,
and
I
want
to
go
a
different
route,"
Trump
told
House
and
Senate
GOP
lawmakers.
"I
have
no
choice."
"Border
security
is
a
serious,
serious
issue
and
a
national
problem,"
Trump
said.
"Most
illegal
immigration
is
coming
from
our
Southern
border."
On
Wednesday
night,
Peña
Nieto
had
said
at
that
time
he
did
not
see
a
need
to
scrap
the
get
together
--
but
he
strongly
reiterated
that
his
country
wouldn't
fund
any
border
wall,
which
Senate
Majority
leader
Mitch
McConnell
said
Thursday
would
cost
$12-$15
billion.
"President
Trump's
insistence
that
Mexico
will
pay
for
the
wall
has
once
again
just
been
proven
as
delusional
fiction
by
the
Mexican
President,"
said
House
Democratic
leader
Nancy
Pelosi.
"The
wall
is
a
multi-billion
dollar
boondoggle
in
the
making,
and
Republicans
should
be
embarrassed
about
their
brazen
hypocrisy
in
enabling
it."
"Mexico
does
not
believe
in
walls.
I've
said
time
again;
Mexico
will
not
pay
for
any
wall,"
the
Mexican
president
said
in
a
video
statement
posted
to
Twitter
and
translated
by
CNN
from
Spanish.
The
back-and-forth
between
the
two
leaders
began
last
year
during
the
first
days
of
the
Trump
campaign
when
he
called
some
Mexicans
entering
the
US
criminals
and
rapists
and
tensions
lingered
throughout
the
2016
contest.
They
escalated
sharply
over
the
last
24
hours
when
Trump
took
executive
action
on
Wednesday
to
begin
the
process
of
erecting
a
wall.
The
President
announced
that
move
while
a
high-level
Mexican
delegation
was
visiting
the
White
House
--
the
first
foreign
representatives
to
come
since
Trump
took
office
--
for
meetings
with
top
officials,
including
Chief
of
Staff
Reince
Priebus
and
adviser
Jared
Kushner.
One
member
of
the
delegation,
Mexican
Foreign
Minister
Luis
Videgaray,
who
had
led
talks
between
his
government
and
the
Trump
transition
team,
was
in
his
car
on
his
way
to
meetings
at
the
Department
of
Homeland
Security
on
Thursday
when
he
suddenly
decided
he
would
not
attend.
"We
will
work
to
schedule
a
future
meeting
and
will
continue
to
keep
the
lines
of
communication
and
partnership
open,"
said
DHS
Spokeswoman
Gillian
Christensen.
In
his
video
address,
Peña
Nieto
also
said
he
had
ordered
government
agencies
to
step
up
protection
for
immigrants.
"I've
asked
for
the
minister
of
Foreign
Relations
to
re-enforce
protection
measures
to
our
citizens,"
he
said.
He
added
that
the
50
Mexican
consulates
in
the
US
will
be
used
to
defend
the
rights
of
immigrants
in
the
country
and
issued
a
call
to
action
to
legislators
and
civic
organizations
to
help
immigrants.
Mexican
delegation
brings
'Mexico
First'
message
Peña
Nieto
closed
his
message
by
saying
Mexico
offers
and
expects
respect.
"Mexico
offers
its
friendship
to
the
people
of
the
United
States
and
expresses
its
wish
to
arrive
at
agreements
with
its
government,
deals
that
will
be
in
favor
of
Mexico
and
the
Mexicans,"
he
said.
Earlier
Wednesday,
Trump
signed
two
executive
orders
directing
construction
of
a
wall
on
the
US-Mexico
border,
boosting
border
patrol
forces,
and
increasing
the
number
of
immigration
enforcement
officers
who
carry
out
deportations.
Meanwhile,
the
Mexican
officials
who
arrived
Wednesday
had
been
expected
to
lay
the
groundwork
for
Peña
Nieto's
visit
next
week,
which
Mexican
diplomats
had
seen
as
an
important
opportunity
to
try
to
move
past
the
anti-Mexico
rhetoric
Trump
used
during
the
campaign
and
a
chance
to
put
the
relationship
back
on
track.
"There
is
...
frustration
with
our
government
and
ourselves
that
we
have
not
been
able
to
tell
the
story
of
this
important
relationship,"
a
Mexican
diplomat
told
CNN
ahead
of
the
delegation's
visit.
"There
are
a
lot
of
stereotypes
of
Mexicans
in
the
US,
but
there
are
also
stereotypes
of
Americans
in
Mexico.
It
is
in
the
interest
of
both
governments
to
explain
what
this
relationship
is
and
what
we
can
do
together."

immigration
has
plummeted
In
a
Monday
speech,
Peña
Nieto
said
his
government
is
prepared
to
negotiate
with
the
US
if
Mexico's
national
sovereignty
is
respected.
He
laid
out
economic
integration
and
respect
for
the
rights
of
migrants
and
the
money
they
send
home
as
his
nation's
key
negotiating
points.
"Neither
confrontation
nor
submission.
Dialogue
is
the
solution,"
Peña
Nieto
said.
Trump
has
suggested
some
of
the
$25
billion
in
annual
remittances
that
migrants
return
home
would
be
retained
to
pay
for
the
border
wall.
Trump
flew
to
Mexico
City
during
his
campaign
to
meet
Peña
Nieto
and
said
they
discussed
a
wall
Trump
has
vowed
to
build
on
the
US
southern
border,
but
not
his
demand
that
Mexico
pay
for
it
--
an
assertion
the
Mexican
president
later
disputed.
"At
the
start
of
the
conversation
with
Donald
Trump,
I
made
it
clear
that
Mexico
will
not
pay
for
the
wall,"
Peña
Nieto
tweeted,
after
their
meeting,
which
was
widely
viewed
as
a
public
relations
disaster
for
Peña
Nieto.
