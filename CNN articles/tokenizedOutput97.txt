unfolds.Washington
(CNN)Donald
Trump
will
become
president
Friday
with
an
approval
rating
of
just
40%,
according
to
a
new
CNN/ORC
Poll,
the
lowest
of
any
recent
president
and
44
points
below
that
of
President
Barack
Obama,
the
44th
president.The
same
people
who
did
the
phony
election
polls,
and
were
so
wrong,
are
now
doing
approval
rating
polls.
They
are
rigged
just
like
before.Following
a
tumultuous
transition
period,
approval
ratings
for
Trump's
handling
of
the
transition
are
more
than
20
points
below
those
for
any
of
his
three
most
recent
predecessors.
Obama
took
the
oath
in
2009
with
an
84%
approval
rating,
67%
approved
of
Clinton's
transition
as
of
late
December
1992
and
61%
approved
of
George
W.
Bush's
transition
just
before
he
took
office
in
January
2001.
The
complete
CNN/ORC
poll
results
Trump's
wobbly
handling
of
the
presidential
transition
has
left
most
Americans
with
growing
doubts
that
the
President-elect
will
be
able
to
handle
the
job.
About
53%
say
Trump's
statements
and
actions
since
Election
Day
have
made
them
less
confident
in
his
ability
to
handle
the
presidency,
and
the
public
is
split
evenly
on
whether
Trump
will
be
a
good
or
poor
president
(48%
on
each
side).
The
President-elect
dismissed
the
poll
findings
on
Twitter:
"The
same
people
who
did
the
phony
election
polls,
and
were
so
wrong,
are
now
doing
approval
rating
polls.
They
are
rigged
just
like
before."
Rep.
Sean
Duffy,
a
Trump
supporter,
said
the
President-elect's
ongoing
battle
with
the
media
has
hurt
his
image.
"What's
happening
here
is
the
public
fight
that
Mr.
Trump
is
having
with
CNN
and
other
media
groups
has
taken
some
skin
off
his
poll
numbers
and
it's
gone
down,"
he
told
CNN's
Chris
Cuomo
Tuesday
on
"New
Day."
Across
all
three
of
these
measures,
Americans'
impressions
of
Trump
have
worsened
since
November.
In
that
time,
disapproval
of
his
handling
of
the
transition
has
climbed
seven
points
to
52%,
the
percentage
who
think
he'll
do
a
good
job
has
dropped
five
points,
and
the
share
saying
they
have
lost
confidence
in
Trump's
ability
to
be
president
grew
10
points.
Trump's
favorability
rating,
a
measure
often
seen
as
a
read
on
a
public
figure's
personality
rather
than
the
job
he
or
she
is
doing,
has
taken
less
of
a
hit,
decreasing
by
just
3
points
to
44%.
That
change
falls
within
the
poll's
margin
of
sampling
error
and
is
not
statistically
significant.
Despite
these
declines,
many
Americans
remain
confident
that
Trump
will
achieve
several
signature
campaign
promises,
with
most
saying
it's
at
least
somewhat
likely
that
he
will
impose
tariffs
on
companies
that
manufacture
goods
in
Mexico
(71%),
renegotiate
NAFTA
(61%)
and
create
good-paying
jobs
in
economically
challenged
areas
(61%).
About
half
think
Trump
will
be
able
to
simplify
the
tax
code
(50%)
or
protect
sensitive
electronic
information
from
theft
by
foreign
governments
(48%).
Fewer,
44%,
say
it's
likely
that
Trump
will
be
able
to
build
a
wall
along
the
border
with
Mexico,
and
just
29%
believe
he
will
be
able
to
get
Mexico
to
reimburse
the
United
States
for
the
construction
of
the
wall.
About
4-in-10
think
the
President-elect
will
be
able
to
defeat
ISIS,
down
from
50%
who
said
so
in
November.
More
broadly,
less
than
half
say
Trump's
priorities
for
the
country
reflect
their
own
(46%
say
so),
and
the
country
is
almost
evenly
divided
on
whether
the
policies
he's
proposed
will
move
the
country
in
the
right
direction
or
the
wrong
one
(48%
right
direction,
49%
wrong
direction).
The
poll
suggests
the
deep
political
divisions
that
drove
the
2016
presidential
campaign
--
between
men
and
women,
whites
and
racial
minorities,
those
holding
college
degrees
and
those
without
and
rural
residents
and
those
in
more
urban
areas
--
continue
unabated
as
Inauguration
Day
approaches.
Trump's
approval
rating
for
handling
the
transition
is
almost
30
points
higher
among
rural
residents
than
it
is
among
urbanites,
nearly
20
points
higher
among
men
than
women
and
among
whites
than
non-whites,
and
13
points
higher
among
whites
without
degrees
than
among
those
who
completed
college.
The
incoming
vice
president,
Mike
Pence,
holds
a
narrowly
net-positive
favorability
rating,
40%
favorable
to
37%
unfavorable.
Republicans
rate
Pence
slightly
lower
than
his
new
boss,
75%
have
a
favorable
view
of
the
VP-to-be
while
89%
have
a
positive
take
on
Trump.
Among
Democrats,
however,
Pence
earns
higher
marks
than
Trump,
16%
see
him
favorably
vs.
9%
who
say
so
about
Trump.
Opinions
on
Melania
Trump
are
mixed,
with
a
sizable
share
still
unsure
how
they
feel
about
the
incoming
first
lady
(36%
favorable,
35%
unfavorable,
28%
unsure).
And
after
a
campaign
in
which
she
largely
remained
off
the
trail,
most
say
they
expect
her
to
take
on
a
mostly
private
role
as
first
lady
rather
than
a
public
one.
About
two-thirds
(67%)
say
they
see
her
remaining
more
in
the
background
and
focusing
on
her
role
as
a
mother
and
wife
than
being
an
advocate
for
issues
and
causes
and
hosting
White
House
functions.
Trump's
daughter,
Ivanka,
who
is
moving
to
Washington,
heads
into
her
role
in
the
first
family
with
more
goodwill
than
her
father
or
the
future
first
lady.
Overall,
44%
have
a
favorable
impression
of
her,
33%
unfavorable,
with
23%
saying
they're
unsure.
The
CNN/ORC
Poll
was
conducted
by
telephone
January
12-15
among
a
random
national
sample
of
1,000
adults.
Results
for
the
full
sample
have
a
margin
of
sampling
error
of
plus
or
minus
three
percentage
points;
it
is
higher
for
subgroups.
