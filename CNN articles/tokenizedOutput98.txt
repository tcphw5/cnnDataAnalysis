(CNN)New
York
City
Mayor
Bill
de
Blasio
said
his
city
will
use
the
courts
to
fight
President
Donald
Trump's
executive
order
to
block
federal
funding
going
to
"sanctuary
cities,"
following
executive
action
Trump
announced
Wednesday."We
think
it's
very
susceptible
to
legal
challenge,"
he
told
CNN's
Alisyn
Camerota
Thursday
on
"New
Day."
"If
they
make
an
attempt
to
pull
that
money,
it
will
be
from
NYPD,
from
security
funding
to
fight
terrorism."
"If
an
attempt
is
made
to
do
that,
we
will
go
to
court
immediately
for
an
injunction
to
stop
it,"
de
Blasio
added.
"We
believe
the
executive
order
is
vague
and
in
some
ways
contradictory."What
are
sanctuary
cities,
and
can
they
be
defunded?
Trump
signed
Wednesday
an
executive
order
that
he
hopes
will
crack
down
and
strip
funding
from
"sanctuary
cities,"
a
term
used
for
jurisdictions
with
policies
that
limit
cooperation
between
or
involvement
with
federal
immigration
enforcement
actions.
The
concept
of
sanctuary
cities
apparently
originated
in
churches
in
the
1980s
that
were
providing
sanctuary
to
Central
Americans
fleeing
violence
in
their
home
countries
despite
the
federal
government
being
reluctant
to
grant
them
refugee
status.
Sanctuary
cities
became
more
popular
in
cities
with
more
diverse
communities
to
counter
what
leaders
considered
extreme
federal
immigration
policies,
especially
against
those
who
were
arrested
for
minor,
non-violent
crimes.
If
enforced,
the
order
will
"strip
federal
grant
money
from
the
sanctuary
states
and
cities
that
harbor
illegal
immigrants,"
said
White
House
Press
Secretary
Sean
Spicer.
The
order
states
that
these
cities
will
be
"not
eligible"
for
federal
grants
and
orders
the
Office
of
Management
and
Budget
to
compile
federal
grant
money
presently
going
to
those
jurisdictions.
De
Blasio
is
among
several
high-profile
mayors
protesting
the
move,
calling
it
a
national
security
disaster.
"It's
going
to
make
cities
less
safe.
That
is
the
bottom
line,"
he
said.
The
NYPD
has
spent
decades
building
relationships
with
immigrant
communities,
de
Blasio
said,
and
if
undocumented
people
fear
deportation
they
will
not
come
forward
to
report
suspected
criminal
activity,
including
terrorism.
"This
is
the
kind
of
thing
that
will
destroy
that
progress
and
make
it
impossible
for
the
police
to
keep
cities
safe,"
he
said.
The
mayor
also
spoke
of
the
need
for
Congress
to
provide
New
York
City
federal
funds
for
securing
the
first
family.
"It's
put
a
huge
strain
on
the
NYPD
to
protect
not
only
the
First
Family
and
the
staff
that's
been
working
at
Trump
Tower
but
Trump
Tower
itself,
which
is
a
very
centrally
located
and
very
vulnerable
building,"
De
Blasio
said.
"It's
costing
us
about
half
a
million
dollars
a
day
to
secure
a
building
that
is
exposed
on."
"We're
going
to
keep
doing
that,
it's
the
right
thing
to
do.
But
we
do
expect
the
Congress
to
reimburse
the
people
of
New
York
City
and
the
NYPD
so
we
can
continue
to
do
the
work
of
safety
all
over
this
city,"
he
said.
Los
Angeles
Mayor
Eric
Garcetti
said
Thursday
that
keeping
funding
from
sanctuary
cities
is
not
"the
right
approach"
to
deal
with
national
security.
"I
don't
think
that
taking
away
city
funding
-
our
tax
dollars
that
we
should
be
able
to
determine
how
we
spend
locally
-
is
the
right
approach
any
more
than
I
think
as
a
father
that
dividing
families
is
the
right
approach,"
he
said
on
CNN's
"At
this
Hour."
The
Democrat
acknowledged
that
the
immigration
system
was
broken
but
expressed
concern
about
straining
the
relationship
between
law
enforcement
and
immigrants.
"We
want
federal
law
enforcement
officials
to
do
their
job
with
federal
laws,
but
we
don't
enforce
tax
laws.
We
don't
enforce
mail
fraud.
And
I
don't
want
to
take
my
cops
off
of
that
important
work
because
of
an
ideological
wish
of
anybody
in
the
White
House,"
he
said.
