(CNN)It's
actually
a
little
hard
to
believe
we,
as
both
a
goat-
and
yoga-loving
society,
have
slept
on
this
concept
for
so
long.
Leave
it
to
Lainey
Morse
of
Albany,
Oregon
to
realize
something
as
glorious
as
goat
yoga.
Her
goat
yoga
classes
have
become
so
popular,
there's
a
1,200-person
waiting
list
that's
growing
by
the
day.
The
classes
are
held
at
Morse's
scenic
Oregon
farm,
where
the
goats
have
open
access
to
the
guests
during
their
practice.
Snuggles
are
not
uncommon,
and
neither
is
the
occasional
upward
goat
on
a
downward
dog.
It's
a
perfect
combination,
Morse
says.
"Goats
are
perfect
for
the
yoga
practice
because
it's
not
only
combining
nature
and
animals,
it's
combining
yoga,
and
they
all
go
together
so
well."
How
goat
yoga
got
started
Morse
owns
a
small
farm
in
a
picturesque
section
of
western
Oregon.
The
farm
is
called
"No
Regrets,"
which
is
fitting
since
Morse
moved
there
on
a
whim
from
Phoenix,
Arizona
and
hasn't
looked
back
since.
She
also
owns
eight
goats
because,
well,
she's
always
wanted
to
own
goats
and
that
is
a
dream
that
should
not
be
deferred.
One
day,
during
a
child's
birthday
party
she
hosted
on
the
farm
as
part
of
a
charity
auction,
a
mother
who
taught
yoga
approached
her
with
an
interesting
suggestion.
"The
woman
said,
'You
should
really
have
a
yoga
class
out
here,"
Morse
said.
"I
said
okay,
but
the
goats
have
to
join
in."
It
didn't
take
much
time
for
the
concept
to
catch
fire.
A
goat
for
the
soul
Even
now,
as
sessions
fill
up
and
the
waitlist
grows
by
dozens
--
or
hundreds
--
every
day,
Morse
marvels
at
how
much
people
are
connecting
to
her
animals.
"The
most
fun
part
for
me
is
watching
people's
faces
when
a
little
goat
comes
up
to
them
while
they're
doing
a
yoga
pose.
It's
a
distraction,
but
it's
a
happy
distraction."
She
says
people
have
come
from
states
away,
and
for
many,
there's
more
to
their
journey
than
just
curiosity
or
a
yen
for
quirky
concepts.
"It
may
sound
silly,
but
goat
yoga
is
really
helping
people,"
Morse
says.
"People
come
in
that
have
anxiety,
depression;
they're
recovering
from
cancer
or
illness."
Morse
also
uses
her
goats
in
animal
assisted
therapy
for
people
that
suffer
from
depression
or
disabilities.
"It's
not
curing
diseases,
but
it's
helping
people
cope
with
whatever
they're
going
through."
Morse
feels
this
on
a
personal
level.
About
a
year
and
a
half
ago,
she
was
diagnosed
with
an
autoimmune
disorder
and
was
going
through
a
tough
time
in
her
personal
life.
"I
would
come
home
every
day
and
spend
time
with
my
goats,
and
it
was
so
therapeutic
for
me,"
she
says.
"It's
hard
to
be
sad
and
depressed
when
there's
baby
goats
jumping
on
you."
Truer
words
have
never
been
spoken.
