(CNN)A
federal
judge
in
New
York
blocked
part
of
President
Donald
Trump's
controversial
executive
order
on
immigration
Saturday,
ruling
that
authorities
could
not
remove
individuals
from
seven
Muslim-majority
countries
who
had
arrived
in
US
airports
after
the
order
had
been
issued.

https://t.co/hUzvqqqd9HThis
story
has
been
updated
to
reflect
the
latest
reporting.US
Judge
Ann
M.
Donnelly
held
that
the
petitioners
had
a
"strong
likelihood
of
success"
in
establishing
that
their
removal
"violates
their
rights
to
Due
Process
and
Equal
Protection
guaranteed
by
the
United
States
Constitution."
Donnelly,
who
was
appointed
to
the
bench
by
President
Barack
Obama,
sits
on
the
US
District
Court
for
the
Eastern
District
of
New
York.
A
White
House
spokesperson
defended
the
order
Sunday,
saying:
"It
is
the
right
and
duty
of
the
President
to
do
everything
in
his
legal
and
constitutional
power
to
protect
the
American
people."
"Saturday's
ruling
does
not
undercut
the
President's
executive
order.
All
stopped
visas
will
remain
stopped.
All
halted
admissions
will
remain
halted.
All
restricted
travel
will
remain
prohibited.
The
executive
order
is
a
vital
action
toward
strengthening
America's
borders,
and
therefore
sovereignty.
The
order
remains
in
place,"
the
spokesperson
said.
The
court's
ruling
came
after
immigration
lawyers
at
the
Americans
Civil
Liberties
Union
and
other
groups
flocked
to
airports
across
the
country
to
come
to
the
aide
of
individuals
who
had
arrived
with
valid
immigrant
visas
and
found
themselves
in
legal
limbo.
The
lawyers
asked
for
a
nationwide
stay
that
would
block
the
deportation
of
all
people
stranded
in
US
airports
under
what
the
group
called
"President
Trump's
new
Muslim
ban."

Donnelly
granted
their
request,
writing:
"There
is
imminent
danger
that,
absent
the
stay
of
removal,
there
will
be
substantial
and
irreparable
injury
to
refugees,
visa-holders,
and
other
individuals
from
nations
subject
to
the
January
27,
2017,
Executive
Order."
Trump's
order,
titled
"Protection
Of
The
Nation
From
Foreign
Terrorist
Entry
Into
The
United
States,"
makes
good
on
his
longtime
campaign
promise
to
tighten
borders
and
halt
certain
refugees
from
entering
the
United
States.
As
well
as
the
ban
on
travel
from
seven
named
countries
for
90
days,
it
also
caps
the
total
number
of
refugees
admitted
into
the
United
States
during
the
2017
fiscal
year
at
50,000,
down
more
than
half
from
the
current
level
of
110,000.
It
halts
all
refugees
from
Syria
indefinitely.
"I
am
establishing
new
vetting
measures
to
keep
radical
Islamic
terrorists
out
of
the
United
States
of
America,"
Trump
said
during
the
signing
at
the
Pentagon.
"We
don't
want
them
here."
As
Donnelly
was
considering
the
case,
lawyers
around
the
country
rushed
to
file
legal
briefs.
Early
Sunday
morning,
a
federal
court
in
Massachusetts
also
issued
a
temporary
restraining
order,
blocking
part
of
the
executive
order
in
a
case
brought
by
lawyers
for
two
lawful
permanent
residents
who
are
college
professors.
That
order,
issued
by
United
States
District
Court
Judge
Allison
D.
Burroughs,
also
an
Obama
appointee,
went
a
step
further
ordering
that
the
government
could
not
"detain
or
remove"
individuals
who
had
arrived
legally
from
the
countries
subject
to
Trump's
order:
Iraq,
Syria,
Iran,
Sudan,
Libya,
Somalia
and
Yemen.
Burroughs
said
that
her
order
applied
to
the
petitioners
in
the
case
as
well
as
those
similarly
situated
including
lawful
permanent
residents,
citizens,
visa-holders,
approved
refugees,
and
other
individuals
from
nations
who
are
subject
to
the
January
27,
2017,
executive
order.
The
order
was
also
signed
by
United
States
Magistrate
Judge
Gail
Dein.
The
judges
specified
that
the
order
would
remain
in
effect
for
seven
days
while
the
court
scheduled
a
hearing.
Lawsuit
success
The
United
States
denied
entry
to
109
travelers
heading
to
the
country
at
the
time
the
ruling
was
signed,
a
Department
of
Homeland
Security
official
said.
The
agency
would
not
say
how
many
of
the
109
were
sent
already
home
and
how
many
were
detained.
The
ruling
does
not
necessarily
mean
the
people
being
held
at
airports
across
the
US
are
going
to
be
released,
said
Zachary
Manfredi,
from
Yale's
Worker
and
Immigrant
Rights
Advocacy
Clinic,
who
helped
draft
the
emergency
stay
motion.
"The
judge's
order
is
that
they
(lawful
visa/green
card
holders)
not
be
removed
from
the
US
--
it
doesn't
immediately
order
that
they
be
released
from
detention,"
he
told
CNN.
"We
are
hoping
that
(Customs
and
Border
Patrol),
now
that
they
no
longer
have
a
reason
to
detain
them,
will
release
them.
But
it
is
also
possible
they
could
be
transferred
to
(other)
detention
facilities,"
Manfredi
said.
"We
are
getting
the
order
to
as
many
(Customs
and
Border
Patrol)
officers
as
possible
right
now,"
he
added.
ACLU
officials
praised
the
judge's
ruling.
"Clearly
the
judge
understood
the
possibility
for
irreparable
harm
to
hundreds
of
immigrants
and
lawful
visitors
to
this
country,"
said
ACLU
executive
director
Anthony
D.
Romero.
"Our
courts
today
worked
as
they
should
as
bulwarks
against
government
abuse
or
unconstitutional
policies
and
orders.
On
week
one,
Donald
Trump
suffered
his
first
loss
in
court."
Lee
Gelernt,
deputy
director
of
the
ACLU's
Immigrants'
Rights
Project,
who
argued
the
case,
said
the
ruling
"preserves
the
status
quo
and
ensures
that
people
who
have
been
granted
permission
to
be
in
this
country
are
not
illegally
removed
off
US
soil."
Lawsuit
is
first
challenge
to
executive
order
The
class-action
lawsuit
in
New
York
is
the
first
legal
challenge
to
Trump's
controversial
executive
order,
which
indefinitely
suspends
admissions
for
Syrian
refugees
and
limits
the
flow
of
other
refugees
into
the
United
States
by
instituting
what
the
President
has
called
"extreme
vetting"
of
immigrants.
The
two
Iraqis,
Hameed
Khalid
Darweesh
and
Haider
Sameer
Abdulkaleq
Alshawi,
had
been
released
by
Saturday
night.
But
lawyers
for
other
detained
travelers
said
in
a
court
filing
that
"dozens
and
dozens"
of
individuals
remained
held
at
JFK.
Similar
legal
actions
were
initiated
in
other
states
before
the
ruling
in
New
York
took
effect.
A
federal
court
in
Washington
state
issued
a
stay
forbidding
travelers
being
detained
there
from
being
sent
back
to
their
home
country.
A
federal
court
in
Virginia
has
issued
a
temporary
restraining
order
saying
several
dozen
permanent
residents
returning
from
trips
abroad
should
have
access
to
lawyers
while
they
are
being
detained
at
Dulles
International
Airport
and
these
residents
cannot
be
removed
from
the
United
States
for
seven
days.
'America
is
the
land
of
freedom'
According
to
court
papers,
both
Darweesh
and
Alshawi
were
legally
allowed
to
come
into
the
US
but
were
detained
in
accordance
with
Trump's
order.
Darweesh,
who
worked
as
an
interpreter
for
the
US
during
the
Iraq
War,
was
released
from
detention
early
Saturday
afternoon.
"America
is
the
land
of
freedom,"
he
told
reporters
at
the
airport
shortly
after
his
release.
"America
is
the
greatest
nation."
A
source
with
knowledge
of
the
case
confirmed
Darweesh
will
be
allowed
into
the
US
due
to
provisions
in
Trump's
order
that
allow
the
State
and
Homeland
Security
departments
to
admit
individuals
into
the
US
on
a
case-by-case
base
for
certain
reasons,
including
when
the
person
is
already
in
transit
and
it
would
cause
undue
hardship
and
would
not
pose
a
threat
to
the
security
of
the
US.
The
suit
said
Darweesh
held
a
special
immigrant
visa,
which
he
was
granted
the
day
of
Trump's
inauguration
on
January
20,
due
to
his
work
for
the
US
government
from
2003
to
2013.
Alshawi
was
released
Saturday
night,
according
to
his
attorney,
Mark
Doss.
Rep.
Nydia
Velazquez,
D-New
York,
who
had
arrived
at
JFK
by
early
Saturday
afternoon
to
try
and
secure
the
release
of
the
two
Iraqis,
railed
against
Trump's
order
and
pledged
continued
action.
"This
should
not
happen
in
America,"
Velazquez
said
following
Darweesh's
release.
"One-by-one,
street-by-street,
if
we
have
to
go
to
court,
we
will
fight
this
anyplace,
anywhere."
'The
executive
order
is
unlawful'
The
lawsuit
said
the
US
granted
Alshawi
a
visa
earlier
this
month
to
meet
with
his
wife
and
son,
whom
the
US
already
granted
refugee
status
for
her
association
with
the
US
military.
The
lawyers
for
the
two
men
called
for
a
hearing
because
they
maintain
the
detention
of
people
with
valid
visas
is
illegal.
"Because
the
executive
order
is
unlawful
as
applied
to
petitioners,
their
continued
detention
based
solely
on
the
executive
order
violates
their
Fifth
Amendment
procedural
and
substantive
due
process
rights,"
the
lawyers
argue
in
court
papers.
Court
papers
said
Customs
and
Border
Patrol
authorities
did
not
allow
the
lawyers
to
meet
with
the
men,
and
told
them
to
try
reaching
Trump.
Velázquez
and
fellow
New
York
Democratic
Rep.
Jerrold
Nadler
said
they
attempted
to
speak
to
Darweesh
and
Alshawi
at
JFK's
Terminal
4
earlier
Saturday
but
were
denied.
"When
Mr.
Darweesh's
attorneys
approached
CBP
requesting
to
speak
with
Mr.
Darweesh,
CBP
indicated
that
they
were
not
the
ones
to
talk
to
about
seeing
their
client.
When
the
attorneys
asked,
'Who
is
the
person
to
talk
to?'
the
CBP
agents
responded,
'Mr.
President.
Call
Mr.
Trump,'
"
the
court
papers
read.
Doss,
an
attorney
with
the
International
Refugee
Assistance
Project,
told
CNN
his
clients
knew
they
had
to
get
to
the
US
as
soon
as
possible
so
they
boarded
the
first
flight
they
could.
The
two
men
had
been
allowed
to
make
phone
calls.
They
do
not
know
each
other,
and
it
is
unclear
if
they
were
held
together
or
separately,
or
if
they
were
kept
in
a
holding
cell,
according
to
Doss.
The
lawsuit
was
earlier
reported
by
The
New
York
Times.
Legality
questioned
But
the
order
immediately
raised
questions
about
its
legal
standing.
"What
this
order
does
is
take
people
who
played
by
the
rules
who
have
been
rigorously
vetted
and
slams
the
door
of
the
country
in
their
face
because
of
their
religion,"
said
David
Leopold,
an
immigration
attorney
and
the
former
president
of
the
American
Immigration
Lawyers
Association.
But
Stephen
Yale-Loehr,
a
professor
of
immigration
law
practice
at
Cornell
Law
School,
said
Trump's
order
may
have
merit.
"The
plaintiffs
are
alleging
a
variety
of
reasons
why
they
should
not
be
detained
under
the
executive
order.
Their
arguments
include
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
Constitution
and
a
provision
in
the
immigration
law
that
prohibits
national
origin
discrimination,"
Yale-Loehr
said.
"However,
presidents
have
wide
discretion
on
immigration,
because
immigration
touches
national
sovereignty
and
foreign
relations.
Courts
tend
to
defer
to
whatever
a
president
declares
on
immigration.
I
think
the
administration
could
win."
An
administration
official
told
CNN
if
a
person
has
a
valid
visa
to
enter
the
US
but
is
a
citizen
of
one
of
the
seven
countries
under
the
temporary
travel
ban,
then
the
person
cannot
come
into
the
US.
If
the
person
landed
after
the
order
was
signed
Friday
afternoon,
then
the
person
would
be
detained
and
put
back
on
a
flight
to
their
country
of
citizenship.
Separately,
Department
of
Homeland
Security
officials
acknowledged
people
who
were
in
the
air
would
be
detained
upon
arrival
and
put
back
on
a
plane
to
their
home
country.
An
official
was
not
able
to
provide
numbers
of
how
many
have
already
been
detained.
Progressives
outraged
Democrats
and
liberal-leaning
groups
continued
to
denounce
Trump's
order
Saturday
as
racist.
"The
first
two
refugees
kept
out
of
America
by
President
Trump's
order
are
Iraqis
who
helped
US
troops
survive
during
the
war,"
Rep.
Jim
Cooper,
D-Tennessee,
said
on
Twitter.
"These
men
risked
their
lives
for
years
to
keep
our
troops
safe.
One
was
with
the
101st
Airborne.
This
is
no
way
to
treat
our
allies."
Vermont
Sen.
Bernie
Sanders
called
the
action
an
"anti-Muslim
order"
that
"plays
into
the
hands
of
fanatics
wishing
to
harm
America."
And
Senate
Minority
Leader
Chuck
Schumer
called
on
the
Trump
administration
to
"rescind
these
anti-American
executive
actions
that
will
do
absolutely
nothing
to
improve
our
safety."
Travelers
turned
away
Sarah
Assali
from
Allentown,
Pennsylvania,
told
CNN
Saturday
that
the
US
government
stopped
six
of
her
Syrian
family
members
at
Philadelphia
International
Airport
and
sent
them
back
to
Doha,
Qatar,
the
origin
city
of
their
flight.
Assali
said
her
family
members
were
persecuted
Christians
and
did
not
speak
very
good
English,
so
they
did
not
fully
understand
why
they
were
being
put
on
a
plane
back
to
the
Middle
East.
Additionally,
some
US-bound
travelers
who
were
either
refugees
or
from
countries
specified
in
Trump's
executive
ban
have
been
turned
back
from
Cairo
International
Airport,
according
to
a
Cairo
airport
official
who
is
not
authorized
to
speak
to
the
media.
The
official
said
they
were
required
to
follow
the
instructions
of
the
United
States
in
the
matter.
He
said
"(The
airport
personnel)
have
no
choice
but
to
follow
orders.
I
don't
want
to
blame
anyone
here."
