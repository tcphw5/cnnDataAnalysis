(CNN)A
US
Navy
Seal
died
of
wounds
suffered
during
a
raid
in
Yemen
against
al
Qaeda
--
the
first
American
combat
death
under
President
Donald
Trump,
US
Central
Command
said
Sunday.CNN's
Hakim
Al-Masmari
and
Tim
Lister
contributed
to
this
report.
Six
other
servicemembers
also
were
wounded,
all
non-life
threatening.
On
Monday,
the
Pentagon
identified
the
service
member
who
was
killed
as
Chief
Petty
Officer
William
"Ryan"
Owens.
President
Donald
Trump
on
Tuesday
callled
Owens'
family,
the
White
House
said.
White
House
Press
Secretary
Sean
Spicer
described
the
call
as
a
"very
somber
and
lengthy
conversation"
with
Owens'
wife,
father
and
children.
"Ryan
gave
his
full
measure
for
our
nation,
and
in
performing
his
duty,
he
upheld
the
noblest
standard
of
military
service,"
Defense
Secretary
James
Mattis
said.
"In
a
successful
raid
against
al
Qaeda
in
the
Arabian
Peninsula
(AQAP)
headquarters,
brave
US
forces
were
instrumental
in
killing
an
estimated
14
AQAP
members
and
capturing
important
intelligence
that
will
assist
the
US
in
preventing
terrorism
against
its
citizens
and
people
around
the
world,"
Trump
said
in
a
statement
Sunday.
"Americans
are
saddened
this
morning
with
news
that
a
life
of
a
heroic
service
member
has
been
taken
in
our
fight
against
the
evil
of
radical
Islamic
terrorism,"
he
added.
"My
deepest
thoughts
and
humblest
prayers
are
with
the
family
of
this
fallen
service
member.
I
also
pray
for
a
quick
and
complete
recovery
for
the
brave
service
members
who
sustained
injuries."
A
US
military
official
said
the
raid
was
not
directed
against
specific
individuals,
but
aimed
at
"site
exploitation,"
a
military
term
to
describe
intelligence-gathering
actions.
Sources
in
Yemen
told
CNN
that
three
senior
al
Qaeda
leaders
were
among
those
killed.
That
was
later
confirmed
by
a
US
official.
"We
are
deeply
saddened
by
the
loss
of
one
of
our
elite
servicemembers,"
Commander
of
US
Central
Command
Gen.
Joseph
Votel
said.
"The
sacrifices
are
very
profound
in
our
fight
against
terrorists
who
threaten
innocent
peoples
across
the
globe."
Ongoing
civil
war
Central
Command
said
an
aircraft
assisting
in
the
operation
experienced
a
hard
landing,
resulting
in
three
US
troops
being
injured.
That
aircraft,
which
a
US
defense
official
said
was
a
V-22
Osprey,
was
unable
to
fly
after
the
landing
and
was
then
intentionally
destroyed
in
place.
The
US
operation
resulted
in
an
estimated
total
of
14
members
of
al
Qaeda
in
the
Arabian
Peninsula
(AQAP)
being
killed
and
the
capture
of
information
that
will
likely
provide
insight
into
the
planning
of
future
terror
plots.
A
US
defense
official
said
the
operation
was
authorized
by
Trump.
The
military
said
there
were
no
civilian
casualties
as
a
result
of
the
raid.
American
military
raids
in
Yemen
are
rare.
The
US
did
conduct
several
drone
strikes
on
AQAP
targets
there
last
week.
Yemeni
officials
told
CNN
that
the
raid
took
place
in
the
Gaifa
region
in
Yemen's
northern
Baitha
province.
US
military
officials
believe
AQAP
is
exploiting
the
ongoing
civil
war
in
Yemen
to
solidify
its
presence
there.
Yemen
is
currently
beset
by
a
conflict
between
Houthi
rebels,
a
minority
Shia
group
from
the
north
of
the
country,
and
the
internationally
recognized
government
led
by
President
Abdu
Rabbu
Mansour
Hadi.
Saudi
Arabia
is
leading
a
military
intervention
against
the
Houthis
in
support
of
the
government.
