(CNN)The
head
of
an
Australian
pharmaceutical
company
is
forcefully
denying
to
CNN
that
Rep.
Tom
Price,
President
Donald
Trump's
pick
to
lead
the
Department
of
Human
Services,
was
offered
a
special
discounted
rate
of
the
firm's
stocks.
And
in
private,
Rep.
Chris
Collins
is
cheering
him
on.
Price's
decision
to
buy
shares
in
Innate
Immunotherapeutics
after
learning
about
the
firm
from
Collins,
a
fellow
GOP
congressman,
has
exacerbated
ethics
concerns
surrounding
his
nomination,
with
Democrats
warning
that
the
investment
has
the
appearance
of
insider
trading.
Both
Price
and
Collins
have
denied
these
accusations.
Simon
Wilkinson,
the
CEO
of
Innate
Immunotherapeutics,
emailed
a
CNN
reporter
late
Monday
with
a
detailed
rebuttal
of
a
Wall
Street
Journal
report,
which
said
Price
had
received
a
"privileged
offer"
to
buy
the
company's
stocks
at
a
discount.
Minutes
later,
Collins,
using
a
personal
email
address,
responded
to
both
Wilkinson
and
the
CNN
reporter
--
accidentally
replying
all
to
the
original
message
that
he
had
been
bcc'd
on.
And
it
appeared
that
Collins
is
pleased
with
the
company's
defense
of
his
colleague.
"Simon.
Yellow
journalism.
Making
the
story
fit
a
bias
regardless
of
the
facts.
Distorted,"
the
email
began,
in
apparent
reference
to
the
WSJ
report.
"In
fact
the
offer
was
made
available
to
every
US
shareholder
who
had
ever
participated
in
any
share
offering
in
the
US.
Interesting
how
he
somehow
distorted
that."
Collins,
who
both
invests
in
and
sits
on
the
board
of
Innate
Immunotherapeutics,
continued
on
to
say
that
"many
US
shareholders"
--
including
his
own
children
--
declined
to
participate
"because
of
the
perceived
risk."
First
on
CNN:
Trump's
Cabinet
pick
invested
in
company,
then
introduced
a
bill
to
help
it
"Yet
he
would
make
the
reader
assume
it
was
a
slam
dunk,"
Collins
complained
again
about
the
WSJ
writer,
before
ending
the
email
with:
"Thanks
for
clarifying.
Chris."
Collins
confirmed
in
a
follow-up
email
to
CNN
Tuesday
morning
that
he
had
"replied
all
by
mistake,"
before
venting
his
frustrations
about
a
"witch
hunt
where
the
press
goes
after
my
friends
and
family."
In
the
case
of
Price's
investment
in
Innate
Immunotherapeutics,
a
"standard
private
placement"
has
been
incorrectly
portrayed
as
"some
kind
of
insider
special
deal,"
Collins
said.
"I
was
venting
to
Simon
as
he
shares
my
frustration."
Wilkinson
also
criticized
the
WSJ's
report
that
Price
received
a
privileged
offer
to
buy
the
company's
stock
at
a
discount.
He
told
CNN
that
Price
was
offered
the
same
price
offered
to
existing
Australian
and
New
Zealand
shareholders,
as
well
as
other
US
shareholders
that
met
the
criteria
of
"accredited
investors."
Wilkinson
also
denied
the
WSJ's
claim
that
"fewer
than
20
US
investors"
including
Price
were
invited
last
year
to
buy
discounted
shares
of
the
company,
described
by
the
WSJ
as
"an
opportunity
that,
for
Mr.
Price,
arose
from
an
invitation
from
a
company
director
and
fellow
congressmen."
"This
statement
is
NOT
factually
correct.
All
Australian
and
New
Zealand
shareholders
(the
company
had
about
2,400
shareholders
at
the
time
of
whom
850
had
actively
supported
share
offerings
over
the
previous
5
or
more
years)
were
'invited'
(offered)
new
shares
at
the
same
discount,"
Wilkinson
said.
"Our
'accredited'
US
resident
shareholders
were
also
made
aware
of
the
offering.
About
600
AU/NZ
shareholders
and
about
20
US
shareholders/investors
took
up
the
'invitation.'"
Wilkinson's
vigorous
defense
of
Price's
stock
purchase
--
along
with
Collins
airing
his
deep
frustration
--
came
just
hours
ahead
of
the
Senate
Finance
Committee's
vote
to
send
Price's
nomination
to
the
full
Senate.
Despite
vehement
objections
from
Democrats,
Price
is
widely
expected
to
be
confirmed
as
Trump's
next
HHS
secretary
in
the
Senate,
where
Republicans
have
a
majority.
But
the
Georgia
congressman
and
orthopedic
surgeon
appears
poised
to
assume
the
prominent
Cabinet
position
without
having
put
to
rest
numerous
conflicts
of
interest
and
ethics
questions.
As
head
of
the
HHS,
Price
will
play
an
outsized
role
in
the
Trump
administration's
efforts
to
repeal
and
replace
Obamacare.
In
two
confirmation
hearings
this
month,
Price
was
emphatic
that
he
didn't
do
anything
that
crossed
legal
and
ethical
lines.
"Everything
I
did
was
ethical,
above
board
legal
and
transparent,"
Price
told
the
Senate
Finance
Committee
last
week.
