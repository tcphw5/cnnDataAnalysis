Actor John Hurt of 'Elephant Man,' 'Midnight Express' and 'Alien' dies at 77
By Ralph Ellis, CNNUpdated 6:59 AM ET, Mon January 30, 2017 Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. (CNN)Actor John Hurt, the gravelly voiced British actor who garnered Oscar nominations for his roles in "Midnight Express" and "The Elephant Man," has died at the age of 77, publicist Charles McDonald said Friday.My deepest sympathies to John Hurt's family, friends and fans. He was a dear friend.Very sad to hear of John Hurt's passing. It was such an honor to have watched you work, sir.CNN's Dottie Evans contributed to this report© 2017 Cable News Network. Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. All Rights Reserved.CNN Sans ™ & © 2017 Cable News Network. McDonald offered no other details of Hurt's passing.
Known for playing tormented characters, Hurt memorably died on screen in the 1979 space adventure "Alien" when a creature exploded from his chest during lunch in the spacecraft mess hall. CNN's "The Screening Room" in 2007 ranked it among its Top 10 favorite movie deaths.
Hurt always stayed busy, working more than six decades in television, movies and voice work in England and the United States. He recently played a priest who counsels Jacqueline Kennedy in last year's biopic "Jackie," according to IMDb.
"I'm very much of the opinion that to work is better than not to work," he said, according to his IMDb bio. "There are others who'd say, 'No, wait around for the right thing' - and they will finish up a purer animal than me. ... Of course, I don't do everything by any means: I do turn lots of stuff down, because it's absolute crap. But I usually find something interesting enough to do."
Accolades poured in on social media.
Actor Kiefer Sutherland tweeted: "My deepest sympathies to John Hurt's family, friends and fans. He was a dear friend."
Actor Elijah Wood tweeted: "Very sad to hear of John Hurt's passing. It was such an honor to have watched you work, sir."
Hurt was born in Shirebrook, a coal mining village in Derbyshire, England, the son of an an engineer and one-time actress and  an Anglican clergyman and mathematician, IMDb said.
He trained to become a painter but, after being accepted into the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, worked on the stage in the early 1960s. 
His first film role came in the "angry young man" drama "Young and Willing" in 1962 and his first major role in "A Man for All Seasons" in 1966, IMDb said. 
His big break came when he portrayed the gay writer and raconteur Quentin Crisp in the mid-1970s television play "The Naked Civil Servant," which was adapted from Crisp's autobiography, IMDb said. 
The good roles kept coming. He went on to play a Turkish prison inmate in "Midnight Express" in 1978 and the gentle, disfigured John Merrick in "The Elephant Man" in 1980. Those roles earned him Oscar nominations and he won a Golden Globe for best supporting actor in "Midnight Express."
He usually played characters with problems, and IMDb said he died 47 times on screen. But Hurt also also had comic roles, such as Jesus in Mel Brooks' "History of the World: Part I" in 1981, which he took on because he'd just done two serious roles and wanted to have some fun, IMDb said.
Hurt appeared in the first two Harry Potter movies, playing wand maker Garrick Ollivander, and did voice work and narration in movies like "Watership Down," "The Plague Dogs," and "Thumbelina." 
Some of his top television roles included Caligula in "I, Claudius" in 1976, General Woundwort in "Watership Down" and the War Doctor in "Doctor Who."
He was awarded the CBE (Commander of the Order of the British Empire) in the 2004 Queen's Birthday Honours List for his services to Drama.
Hurt was married four times and was married to Anwen Rees-Myers when he died. Hurt was an alcoholic for years but said he quit drinking in 2005, according to IMDb.
A grand scheme never guided his life, he said.
"I've just been whipped along by the waves I'm sitting in," he said, according to IMDb. "I don't make plans at all. Plans are what make God laugh. You can make plans, you can make so many plans, but they never go right, do they?"

Trump considers executive order on voter fraud
By Dan Merica, Eric Bradner and Jim Acosta, CNNUpdated 6:57 PM ET, Wed January 25, 2017 Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. (CNN)President Donald Trump could sign an executive order or presidential memorandum initiating an investigation into voter fraud as early as Thursday, a senior administration official tells CNN. The investigation would be carried out through the Department of Justice.CNN's Eleanor Mueller and Theodore Schleifer contributed to this report.The move would expand on Trump's interest in the unproven claims he has made since November's election alleging millions of illegal votes were cast, without citing any evidence.
"I will be asking for a major investigation into VOTER FRAUD, including those registered to vote in two states, those who are illegal and ... even, those registered to vote who are dead (and many for a long time). Depending on results, we will strengthen up voting procedures!" Trump wrote in two consecutive tweets Wednesday morning.
The President wants to discuss the issue with Republican lawmakers Thursday in Philadelphia and will then consider the best way to go about starting the investigation.
"He wants to tell them more about why he is talking about voter fraud" before taking any action, the official said.
Should Trump decide on the best course of action, the official said, the move could come as early as Thursday. There is some concern within the Trump White House about initiating the action before Sen. Jeff Sessions, Trump's pick to be attorney general, is confirmed by the Senate.
Trump lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton by nearly 3 million votes in November, but won the Electoral College and thus the presidency. Trump, however, has seemingly been fixated on the popular vote, mentioning voter fraud in regards to his popular vote loss a number of times since November.
Trump's initial comments on voter fraud came Monday during a meeting with congressional leaders, where he reiterated an unsubstantiated claim that 3 to 5 million illegal votes cost him the popular vote, according to two sources familiar with the meeting.
The claims continued into Wednesday, when ABC News pressed the President on his opinion during an interview at the White House.
"You have people that are registered who are dead, who are illegals, who are in two states. You have people registered in two states. They're registered in a New York and a New Jersey. They vote twice. There are millions of votes, in my opinion," Mr. Trump said. 
The President insisted that he wants the voting process to be legitimate, pointing to a Pew report that his spokesman, Sean Spicer, used to bolster claims that there are millions of illegal votes cast during presidential elections. When ABC's David Muir told the President that the author of that report told him on Tuesday night that he found no evidence of voter fraud, Trump said that the author was "groveling."
Trump said he wants to launch an investigation into the matter. 
"Of those votes cast, none of them come to me. None of them come to me. They would all be to the other side. None of them come to me. But when you look at the people registered, dead, illegal, and two states, and some cases maybe 3 states. We have a lot to look into," he said.
David Becker, the director of the Pew study in question, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer Tuesday on "The Situation Room" that "there is absolutely no evidence of voter fraud even approaching (the) scale" suggested by Trump.
"I agree completely with the secretaries of state across the country, both Republicans and Democrats, and the National Association of Secretaries of State which is bipartisan, which has said, there is absolutely no evidence of voter fraud even approaching that scale," he said.
"Does voter fraud exist? Yes, it does, in very small numbers. And the election officials around the country are working to investigate and prosecute those dozens of cases that might occur nationwide in an election like this. But three to five million illegal votes -- that would have been discovered not just on Election Day, but well before," he added. "Fraudulent registrations, not matching the drivers license numbers and social security numbers, flagged for ID under federal law, extra provisional ballots being cast -- all of these things we would have seen, and there was zero evidence of that."
On Tuesday, Spicer vigorously defended Trump's statement about illegal voters, though neither Trump nor his surrogates could provide evidence that any substantial illegal voting had occurred or influence the popular vote. 
"I think in terms of registration, where you have got folks on rolls that have been deceased or moved or registered in two counties -- this isn't just about the 2016 election. This is about the integrity of our voting system," Spicer said Wednesday.
No proof for fraud claims
Trump faced widespread criticism for his remarks, including from some congressional leaders in his own party, and Democrats have alleged that Republican efforts in the name of fighting voter fraud has the effect of preventing or delaying legal voters who traditionally back Democratic candidates 
Ohio's secretary of state replied to Trump's tweet on Wednesday, saying his office already investigated claims of voter fraud.
"I responded ... for Ohioans, to let them know we already have an investigation, or review as we call it, underway," Jon Husted, a Republican, told CNN's Carol Costello Wednesday. "In the past ... we found less than a thousand cases of voter irregularity, less than a couple hundred cases of voter fraud, and zero cases of voter suppression."
Considering Ohio is home to about 7 million registered voters, these cases constitute "a small number," Husted said. 
The reviews, which take place every two years, are best conducted at the state level, Husted said. 
"I don't think that federal involvement is important in this particular matter, because the states run the elections," Husted said. "We don't want federal involvement in our elections, we want to keep this in the hands of the states -- that's where it should be." 
Former Democratic National Committee chair Rep. Debbie-Wasserman Schultz issued a harsh condemnation of Trump's call for an investigation, telling CNN's "New Day" that the tweet's message was "deeply disturbing."
"He seems to be questioning the legitimacy of his own election, all while, for the last couple of months, touting how legitimate and huge his election was and historic it is. It can't be both," she said. 
"What is the most deeply disturbing about his penchant for lying is -- if he is willing to lie about the trivial, like crowd size, or the significant, like voter fraud, then what happens if -- God forbid -- we go to war and we have our troops lives on the line and there are causalities? Is he going to send Sean Spicer out to lie about the causalities that have taken place? Are our allies going to be able to trust us?"
And former President Barack Obama's senior adviser David Axelrod responded on CNN on Wednesday by saying, "It becomes an impetus for those who want to further erode voter protection for people who legitimately want to vote and are facing a series of barriers."
When pushed by the media about whether Trump will call for an investigation into the matter, Spicer said, "maybe we will," adding later that Trump believes in voter fraud based on "studies and information he has."
"The President does believe that, I think he's stated that before, and stated his concern of voter fraud and people voting illegally during the campaign and continues to maintain that belief based on studies and evidence people have brought to him," Spicer said at Wednesday's press briefing.
Spicer did not say specifically Tuesday which studies the President was using to support his claim of 3 million to 5 million illegally cast votes, but a 2014 study by Jesse Richman and David Earnest found more than 14% of non-citizens in 2008 and 2010 "indicated that they were registered to vote." Only US citizens can vote in federal elections. 
However, Brian Schaffner, a political scientist at the University of Massachusetts, told CNN on Tuesday that his study that is apparently being cited by the White House was misinterpreted and did not support the administration's claims.
A number of studies have also found no evidence of widespread voter fraud.
The Truth About Voter Fraud, a report written by experts at The Brennan Center for Justice, found voter fraud rates were between 0.00004% and 0.0009%.
Trump himself -- through his lawyers -- has also argued that there was no evidence of voter fraud in the 2016 election. In a court filing objecting to Green Party candidate Jill Stein's Michigan recount petition, lawyers for the president wrote, "All available evidence suggests that the 2016 general election was not tainted by fraud or mistake."
Legal issues on voter rolls 
Judges have identified examples of systemic efforts to distort the voter rolls in recent years. 
But those efforts hurt traditionally Democratic voters and help Republicans.
In North Carolina, a federal appeals court wrote in 2016 that -- after receiving data on the use of voting practices by race -- the Republican-controlled state legislature enacted a series of laws designed to suppress African-American turnout with "almost surgical precision." 
The state required voters to present forms of identification disproportionately used by white people. It cut back on early voting, eliminated same-day voter registration and preregistration for voters under 18, and it eliminated Sunday voting -- with the state even arguing in court that "counties with Sunday voting in 2014 were disproportionately black" and "disproportionately Democratic."  
US Circuit Judge Diana Motz wrote in July 2016, in a ruling striking down North Carolina's, that the laws were "enacted with racially discriminatory intent."
"The General Assembly enacted them in the immediate aftermath of unprecedented African American voter participation in a state with a troubled racial history and racially polarized voting," Motz wrote.
Still, many North Carolina counties worked around Motz's ruling. Guilford, the state's third-largest county, opened just one polling place for the first week of early voting. Charlotte's Mecklenburg County chopped its early voting locations from 22 when early voting began in 2012 to 10 in 2016, with voters reporting waiting in line for three hours. 
Democrats also believe that new voter ID laws played a role in lowering turnout in other states -- particularly Wisconsin, where Hillary Clinton narrowly lost to Trump. Turnout there dropped nearly four points from 2012, despite record early voting numbers.

Throw out homeopathic teething tablets with belladonna, FDA says
Set edition preference:Set edition preference:Set edition preference:By Susan Scutti, CNNUpdated 6:38 PM ET, Fri January 27, 2017 Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. (CNN)The Food and Drug Administration urged parents Friday to not use Hyland's homeopathic teething products containing belladonna, commonly known as deadly nightshade -- a toxic substance. See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.Standard Homeopathic Co., the Los Angeles-based maker of Hyland's, discontinued its product October 7. 
"We discontinued it because we are committed to our moms and our dads who choose to trust us to put medicines in their young infants' mouths, and we didn't want to put them in a place between the FDA warning and us saying the product was safe and having to decide who to trust," said Mary C. Borneman, a spokeswoman for Hyland's.
Homeopathic teething tablets, which have been around since the early 1900s, provide temporary relief to babies growing their first teeth.
The FDA originally issued a safety alert in 2010 that recommended against Hyland's Teething Tablets based on laboratory results showing that they contained inconsistent amounts of belladonna. Since then, the agency has received more than 400 reports of adverse events linked to teething products that contain belladonna. 
"Most describe serious adverse events, like seizures," said Lyndsay Meyer, a spokeswoman for the FDA. "We are also aware of reports of 10 deaths during that time period that reference homeopathic teething products." 
Whether these deaths directly relate to teething products "has not yet been determined and is currently under review," Meyer added.
The FDA issued a second belladonna warning in September. Though Hyland's discontinued the product in October, it continued to affirm the safety on its website. 
"Our understanding is that the Food and Drug Administration's investigation of these products is still ongoing," says the company's news release issued at that time. "The fact is that we have not been made aware of any medical or statistical evidence to support a causal link between homeopathic teething tablets and adverse outcomes at this point. We continue to request any available information and statistics from the FDA."
The FDA announcement Friday confirms its original laboratory assessment of inconsistent amounts of belladonna. 
"They showed some limited data on samples they tested that indicated inconsistent amounts of belladonna alkaloid at the nanogram level," Borneman said. However, the results "remained within the documented margin of safety."
"The implication in the FDA release is that consumers who still have the product shouldn't use it because it might be unsafe," she said. 
The FDA release noted that Raritan Pharmaceuticals, based in New Jersey, recalled three of its belladonna-containing homeopathic products in November, yet Hyland's had not issued a recall.
"They never actually asked us to recall it, nor did we ever actually refuse to recall it," Borneman said. "We're a 114-year-old company. Families are the core of what we do. If we really thought there were any safety issues, we would definitely take the next step."
Typically, labels claim that homeopathic teething products contain "natural ingredients," such as chamomile, a daisy-like plant recommended by midwivees for calming babies with colic, and calcarea carbonica, which is made from shells and is, essentially, an impure version of calcium carbonate an ingredient used in antacids.
Some also include belladonna. 
"Since the body's response to belladonna in children under 2 years of age is unpredictable, using such products places them at unnecessary risk," Meyer said. Therefore, the FDA recommends that parents stop giving babies any product that contains belladonna "and dispose of any in their possession."
Instead of teething gels or tablets, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends gently rubbing or massaging the child's gums with your finger and giving the child a cool (not cold) teething ring or a clean, wet, cool washcloth to chew on. 
Though they're discontinued, Borneman stands by the safety of Hyland's Teething Tablets: "They are a top-selling product and a consumer favorite, and sadly it resulted in the loss of 24 jobs."

Chile wildfires: At least 11 die in catastrophe

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. (CNN)A chain of wildfires has unleashed a catastrophe over wide swaths of central and southern Chile, killing at least 11 people, destroying thousands of homes and consuming an area about three times the size of New York City, authorities said.

"We have never seen anything on this scale, never in the history of Chile," President Michelle Bachelet, who has declared a state of emergency, said earlier this week.
"The truth is that the forces are doing everything humanly possible and will continue until they can contain and control the fires."
Many of those killed are firefighters battling more than 100 separate fires, about half of which are still uncontrolled, according to government reports. 
Bachelet said she planned to meet with the intelligence heads of police and armed forces to discuss the investigation into the cause.
"Because there are multiple points of origin, we cannot dismiss the possibility that there might be an intentional component here," she said Thursday in Santiago.  
"We are strongly following this and have been investigating it for some days, and I want to know how far we've gotten." 
The blazes, which began nearly two weeks ago, have spread quickly amid historically high temperatures and an ongoing drought. Nearly 240,000 hectares (593,000 acres) -- about three times the size of New York City -- have burned. 
France, Russia, the United States and Peru have sent international help to combat the fires following last week's declaration of a state of emergency in some of the worst-affected areas. Additionally, aid from Mexico and Colombia was expected to arrive this week.
The US Embassy in Chile said this week that US Agency for International Development was donating $100,000 USD to the nongovernmental organization Caritas Chile for the purchase and delivery of firefighting equipment, such as chainsaws and weather monitoring tools. 
Additionally, the US Forest Service sent a four-member emergency response team of technical experts to work with local authorities. 
The South America nation is vulnerable to earthquakes, forest fires, floods, and volcanic eruptions.
In 2014, a wildfire swept through hundreds of homes in the Pacific coastal city of Valparaiso, leaving at least 12 dead, according to an official.
At least 2,000 homes destroyed by the blaze and 8,000 people left without a place to live.

US official confirms Trident missile failure
Set edition preference:Set edition preference:Set edition preference:By Barbara Starr and James Masters, CNNUpdated 7:25 PM ET, Mon January 23, 2017 Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.Washington (CNN)A missile test involving Britain's Trident nuclear deterrent system ended in failure off the coast of Florida last year, a US defense official with direct knowledge of the incident told CNN on Monday. Asked Michael Fallon whether we should believe the US official who just told CNN Trident missile self destructed.How can we be told less than them? #takebackcontrol https://t.co/hgm8K2wmTSCNN's Barbara Starr reported from Washington. James Masters wrote from London. Richard Greene contributed to this report.The official told CNN that the incident, which happened last June in an the area off the Florida coast used by the US and the UK for missile tests, did not in involve a nuclear warhead. 
Britain's Sunday Times newspaper reported that the missile veered towards the US coast, but the US official told CNN that this trajectory was part of an automatic self-destruct sequence. The official said the missile diverted into the ocean  -- an automatic procedure when missile electronics detect an anomaly.
READ: Trump's blast sends chill across Europe
A month after the test, the UK parliament approved the renewal of Trident at a cost of £40 billion. Unaware of the failure, members of the House of Commons voted by 472 votes to 117 in favor of renewal.
On Sunday, British Prime Minister Theresa May was asked four times during an interview with the BBC's Andrew Marr Show whether she knew of the missile failure before the vote. May refused to answer.
Government challenged on CNN report
Forced to make a statement on the controversy in the House of Commons on Monday, British Defense Secretary Michael Fallon said he had "absolute confidence" in Trident but refused to give "operational details" about the test.
CNN published this story just as Fallon spoke, and Mary Creagh, of the opposition Labour Party demanded to know why he would not give any further details.
Citing CNN's story she said: "The Secretary of State has advised us not to believe everything we read in the Sunday newspapers, but should we believe the [US] official who, while we've been sitting here debating, has confirmed to CNN that the missile did auto-self-destruct off the coast of Florida? And if that is the case, why is the British parliament and the British public the last people to know?"
Fallon once again declined to give "operational details".
Another Labour lawmaker, Chris Byrant, said the reporting by CNN and the Sunday Times demonstrated the need for a full investigation.
"We deplore the leakage of any information about the nuclear deterrent but it is not for me to comment on what may or may not be said by the United States administration," Fallon replied. "This is our submarine, our deterrent, and it is our responsibility to apply to it the very highest security classification."
May under fire
The UK government's refusal to discuss the missile failure has prompted criticism from opponents of the UK's nuclear deterrent.
Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted: "This is a hugely serious issue. There should be full disclosure of what happened, who knew what/when, and why House of Commons wasn't told."
Earlier on Monday, a spokeswoman for May said she was briefed on the Trident test when she came into office.
The Prime Minister and the Defense Secretary are routinely informed about tests and their outcome, May's spokeswoman told reporters.
"These are known as a 'demonstration and shakedown' test. This test was in June (2016) under the last prime minister (David Cameron). On taking office the current Prime Minister (Theresa May) was briefed on a range of nuclear issues, including this. This test saw the submarine and crew successfully tested and certified."
May will become the first world leader to meet with new US President Donald Trump when they hold talks in Washington on Friday.

Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers
By Ariane de Vogue, Eli Watkins and Alanne Orjoux, CNNUpdated 4:01 PM ET, Sun January 29, 2017 Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

Tag #CNNiReport on social or use WhatsApp +44 7435 939 154 to share stories. (CNN)The US Department of Homeland Security said on Sunday it will comply with judicial orders not to deport detained travelers affected by President Donald Trump's seismic move to ban more than 130 million people from entering the United States.IranIraqSyriaSudanLibyaYemenSomalia134 million banned from USWhat the ban says: The full textCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Laura Ly, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.A  federal judge in New York temporarily blocked the order Saturday night for citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries who have already arrived in the US and those who are in transit, and who hold valid visas, ruling they cannot be removed from the US.
That move limited part of President Donald Trump's executive order barring citizens from those countries from entering the US for the next 90 days.
Similar legal rulings were made in Virginia and Washington State. In Massachusetts, however, two judges went further, saying the government should notify travelers who would have been affected by the executive order that for the next seven days they are free to travel to Boston.
"Customs and Border Protection shall notify airlines that have flights arriving at Logan Airport of this Order and the fact that individuals on these flights will not be detained or returned based solely on the basis of the Executive Order," Judges Allison Burroughs and Judith Dein wrote.  
Meanwhile, the Department of Homeland Security said it "will comply with judicial orders; faithfully enforce our immigration laws, and implement the president's Executive Orders to ensure that those entering the United States do not pose a threat to our country or the American people." 
Here are the latest developments:
• Two Iraqis who were named as the petitioners in the legal action had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers said in a court filing that "dozens and dozens" of people remained in detention at John F. Kennedy airport in New York.
• Protests are scheduled Sunday at least cities nine cities: Orlando, Boston, Philadelphia, New York, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Seattle, Washington and Chicago, mostly at airports. On Saturday protesters converged on at least eight major US airports, demonstrating against the policy.
• President Trump said the government was "totally prepared" for the ban. "It's working out very nicely," Trump told reporters Saturday. "You see it at the airports. You see it all over." However. there was widespread confusion across the country as authorities at airports struggled to adjust to the new directives.
Trump order blocked
On Saturday evening, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) argued in a federal court in New York for a nationwide stay that would block the deportation of all people stranded in US airports under what the group called "President Trump's new Muslim ban." 
 US District Judge Ann Donnelly granted the stay.
"The petitioners have a strong likelihood of success in establishing that the removal of the petitioner and other similarly situated violates their due process and equal protection guaranteed by the United States Constitution," Donnelly wrote in her decision.
"There is imminent danger that, absent the stay of removal, there will be substantial and irreparable injury to refugees, visa-holders, and other individuals from nations subject to the January 27, 2017, Executive Order."
The civil rights group is representing dozens of travelers held at John F. Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States.
The ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion.
"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention," he told CNN.
"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities."
"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now," he added.
The United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained.
ACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying "our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court."
Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling "preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil."
Lawsuit is first challenge to executive order
The class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called "extreme vetting" of immigrants. 
The two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that "dozens and dozens" of individuals remained held at JFK.
Similar legal actions had been initiated in other states..
A federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. 
A federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days.
Federal judges in Boston have ruled early Sunday that officials may not detain a person on the basis of President Trump's executive order. This ruling was made after the ACLU of Massachusetts filed a lawsuit asking for the release of two associate professors at the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth, both Iranian nationals who are permanent residents of the United States. 
The Massachusetts suit was filed after the federal judge in New York City granted a stay of removal on behalf of two Iraqi nationals and others "similarly situated" who have been cleared to enter the United States.
Trump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated "only for nationals of countries for whom" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted.
Released under special circumstances
According to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order.
Darweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. 
"America is the land of freedom," he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. "America is the greatest nation."
A source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US.
The suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013.
Alshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss.
Rep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action.
"This should not happen in America," Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. "One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere."
'The executive order is unlawful'
The lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military.
The lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal.
"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights," the lawyers argue in court papers.
Court papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied.
"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'" the court papers read.
Doss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. 
The two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss.
"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States," said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC.
The lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times.
Legality questioned
Trump's executive order, titled "Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States," makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States.
The countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000.
"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America," Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. "We don't want them here."
An administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. 
Department of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained.
After the federal orders were issued, the department said it "will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. 
"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. 
"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security."

Doctors remove 6-foot tapeworm through man's mouth
Set edition preference:Set edition preference:Set edition preference:By Robert Jimison, CNNUpdated 3:43 PM ET, Fri January 27, 2017 Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. (CNN)Doctors in India were stunned to remove a tapeworm measuring more than 6 feet through a patient's mouth, according to a report published this week in the New England Journal of Medicine.See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.Dr. Cyriac Phillips wrote in an email that the 48-year-old man underwent a colonoscopy in 2014 after complaints of "tolerable" abdominal pain that had gone on for two months and test results indicating low hemoglobin concentrations in his blood. 
While performing the colonoscopy, Phillips discovered part of the worm.
"It was an undulating, moving piece of the worm, " he said, "This worm segment was confirmation that there was a tapeworm infestation in this patient." 
After the initial discovery, doctors performed an endoscopy, a procedure using a camera inserted into the patient's stomach to view the intestines. During the procedure, Phillips and his team were able to see images of the lengthy parasite residing in the small intestine. 
After sedating the man, a team of physicians at the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences Hospital in New Delhi was able to extract the worm by pulling it through his mouth with a pair of forceps. 
When removed, the tapeworm measured 6.1 feet and was classified as a Taenia solium, otherwise known as a pork tapeworm. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a fully grown adult worm typically measures between 2 and 7 meters (6.5 to 23 feet) in length, but there have been cases reporting worms more than 8 meters (26 feet) long. 
"We had absolutely no idea regarding the length of this worm," Phillips said. "It kept on coming.
"We pulled at it softly and steadily, and ultimately the job was done after maybe around 1 hour and 15 minutes. I have never seen a tapeworm this long before this particular case." 
After the procedure, doctors prescribed praziquantel, a medication used to treat parasitic worm infections, to kill any eggs or larvae potentially remaining in the man's intestines. 
Doctors advised the patient and his family to take deworming medication for the next six months. 
Phillips also warned about potential food contamination, suggesting the man avoid places with poor sanitation and "to cook pork well at home before consumption."
Pork tapeworm infections, medically diagnosed as cysticercosis, are contracted by ingesting tapeworm eggs. These eggs can then spread through contaminated food and drinking water as well as surfaces with contaminated feces.

George Orwell's '1984' hits bestseller list again
Set edition preference:Set edition preference:Set edition preference:By Eric Levenson, CNNUpdated 6:56 PM ET, Wed January 25, 2017 Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. (CNN)2017 has been "doubleplusgood" for sales of George Orwell's "1984."The famed dystopian novel of life in a totalitarian state sat at No. 6 on Amazon's bestseller list Tuesday morning. On Monday, too, the book hovered between No. 5 and No. 7 on that same bestseller list, as CNN's Brian Stelter noted in his Reliable Sources newsletter. 
First published in 1949 and imagining a future authoritarian society, "1984" is widely regarded as one of the most influential novels of the 20th century. Its state, Oceania, employs a language called Newspeak (and words like "doubleplusgood") to limit freedom of thought.
The book focuses in particular on the impact of omnipresent government surveillance and the state's use of propaganda to enforce orthodoxy to an all-powerful leader, known as "Big Brother."
The novel's newfound popularity comes several days after White House press secretary Sean Spicer argued defiantly that Trump's swearing-in Friday drew the largest-ever audience for an inauguration "period," despite obvious photo and statistical evidence to the contrary.
Senior Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway later defended that argument by saying Spicer's false claims were actually "alternative facts." 
That phrasing was reminiscent of Orwell's "Ministry of Truth," which, he wrote, concerns itself with "lies."
The book's bestseller status isn't necessarily just due to Team Trump, as "1984" remains required reading in most schools.
The Amazon bestseller list is updated hourly, so "1984's" time near the top may not last long. It currently sits just after Connor Franta's "Note to Self" and before Margot Lee Shetterly's "Hidden Figures."
This isn't the first time "1984" has seen a sales spike in recent years. The book also hit Amazon's bestseller list in 2013 after Edward Snowden revealed the extent of the National Security Agency's surveillance program.
