Ikea flat-pack refugee shelter named 2016 Design of the Year 
By Allyssia Alleyne, CNN Updated 8:16 PM ET, Sun January 29, 2017 Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. (CNN)A flat-pack refugee shelter developed by Ikea and the United Nations has been named the best design of 2016. Awarded the Beazley Design of the Year award, presented by the Design Museum in London, the modular Better Shelter is made from recyclable plastic, comprises only 68 components, and can be assembled in as few as four hours. 
Each structure is large enough to house a family of five, and includes a solar panel to power lights and charge devices. Since production started in 2015, 16,000 units have been delivered to countries around the world including Iraq, Djibouti, Greece and Niger, to be used as homes, temporary clinics and offices. 
"Better Shelter tackles one of the defining issues of the moment: providing shelter in an exceptional situation whether caused by violence or disaster," said juror Jana Scholze, an associate professor of curating contemporary design at Kingston University, in a statement.

"Providing not only a design, but secure manufacture as well as distribution makes this project relevant and even optimistic. It shows the power of design to respond to the conditions we are in and transform them." 
The shelter triumphed over more eye-catching nominees, including an Adidas running shoe made of recycled plastic retrieved from the ocean; Grafton Architects' Universidad de Ingeniería y Tecnología building in Lima, Peru, which won the 2016 RIBA International Prize; and Herzog & de Meuron's new addition to London's Tate Modern. 
This isn't the first time that social impact has won out over glamour for the top prize. 
Last year, a microchip-like device that can mimic the functions of human organs beat out Google's self-driving car, Fondation Louis Vuitton's Frank Gehry-designed museum, and a Star Wars-inspired runway collection by Rodarte, among other entries.

What Finland's plan to be tobacco-free can teach the world
Set edition preference:Set edition preference:Set edition preference:By Meera Senthilingam, CNNUpdated 4:40 AM ET, Thu January 26, 2017 Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. (CNN)The Finnish government has set an ambitious goal for residents in a bid to benefit their health -- and their bank balances.See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.Officials plan to make the country tobacco-free by 2040, meaning they want less than 2% of their adults to consume tobacco -- in any form -- by that deadline.
So that's more than 98% of the Finnish population saying no to cigarettes, snuff and other forms of smokeless tobacco, cigars, pipes and even e-cigarettes. 
As per the trend in industralized countries, smoking rates in Finland have been on the decline in recent decades due to measures such as bans on advertising and shop displays, and the creation of smoke-free public spaces. In 2013, 16% of 15- to 64-year-olds in Finland smoked on a daily basis, while nearby in the UK, 19% of adults were smokers in 2014. 
But at the start of this year, a new level of control measures came into force.
"The Finnish approach is revolutionary," said Kaari Paaso, head of the unit on harm prevention at the country's Ministry of Health and Social Affairs. "We want to get rid of all tobacco products." 
Experts agree that the Finnish government is using innovation and creativity to get everyone to kick the habit.
Rather than targeting one area at a time, such as exposure in public spaces or cigarette use, Paaso said his ministry wants to be precautionary from every angle. It doesn't go down the path of advocating milder products that may do less harm, such as e-cigarettes or snuff. "It's a comprehensive set of policies," he said.
For example, neighboring Sweden has also seen a dramatic reduction in the number of smokers -- just 12.7% among men and 15.2% among women in 2013 -- but achieved this in part by promoting the use of snus, an oral smokeless tobacco product. The product, along with all other forms of oral tobacco, is banned in other member states of the European Union.
The UK is also adopting a harm reduction approach to reduce the number of smokers. Instead of snus, it backs the use of e-cigarettes to help people kick the habit.
But Finland wants rid of it all.
"We don't want to fall into the trap of other policies that have less harmful products," said Paaso, who fears that promoting other products will result in a new addiction for health officials to deal with in the future. "We want to phase out all products."
And that phasing out has begun.
Raising the cost of selling tobacco
Experts agree that one of the strongest policies in terms of tobacco control globally has been taxation. The rising cost of the habit, linked to higher taxes, has meant that many can no longer afford to smoke, and those who can smoke provide revenue for anti-smoking campaigns and quitting support services, to name a few options.
"The evidence suggests increasing pricing is the single most effective way to reduce demand," said Vaughan Rees, director of the Center for Global Tobacco Control at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. 
"In states where we see the highest tax rates, we see the lowest prevalence," he said, highlighting New York City, where then-Mayor Michael Bloomberg introduced city taxes on top of state taxes in 2010. Just over 14% of New Yorkers smoked in 2016, according to the NYC Smoke-Free program.
So Finland has now introduced another giant financial barrier for users: It increased the costs for vendors selling tobacco products.
"There's quite a high fee to license it and to sell it," Paaso said.
Any business wanting to sell tobacco must first apply and pay for a license, a one-off process, but an additional fee must be paid annually to cover the costs of surveillance officers in each municipality who will check that retailers are following the rules.
The surveillance fee is the killer, as this is calculated per checkout or cashier in any business and can be as high as €500 ($536) annually per checkout.
The fee is now set by individual municipalities, not the state, many of whom have decided this upper limit should be the actual cost. 
"This has resulted in criticism from small shop owners and big stores ... saying it is disproportionally high from last year," Paaso said. "But that was not the idea." The ministry had hoped the fee would be scaled up annually.
A store with 10 checkouts could therefore pay more than $5,000 per year in addition to its license fee to sell tobacco to the public.
"Finland has come very far ... and now they're going to the next level, with innovation," said Kelly Henning, director of the public health program at Bloomberg Philanthropies, an organization working to promote impactful tobacco control policies, founded by the former New York mayor.
Henning highlights that the World Health Organization's Tobacco Free Initiative has six steps it recommends for effective control, known as MPOWER. The last letter stands for "Raising taxes on tobacco."
"They have in place all MPOWER policies at the highest possible level," she said.
Smoke-free balconies and cars
Another unique approach the Scandinavian country implemented this month was the ability to apply for a ban on people smoking on neighboring balconies if their presence is a disturbance. 
Housing companies may now apply for the ban if smoke is seen to be spreading from someone's private balcony and onto other spaces. As in many other countries, bans are in place in public areas, but this new policy addresses a smoker's private space.
"You can apply for a ban," Paaso said. "There hasn't been big change ... but these measures are still quite new."
Finnish residents are also no longer allowed to smoke in private cars if people under the age of 15 are present. This is not unique, as other countries such as the UK have imposed bans in cars when children are present. In the UK, the cutoff age is higher, at 18.
Preventing the appeal to minors
One key strategy in Finland's approach to eradicate smoking is reducing the number of teenagers picking up the habit in the first place, by reducing its presence and its appeal.
As a result, new policies also limit the purchase of products that imitate tobacco or cigarettes, such as sweets and chocolates shaped as pipes or cigarettes. Though these products aren't banned, they face restrictions. For example, stores where customers receive discounts through the use of a loyalty card cannot offer such discounts on such items.
But much bigger restrictions face the e-cigarette industry. "E-cigarettes are sold in normal shops, but we have strict rules," Paaso said.
As of August, e-cigarettes had the same restrictions in terms of sales and public use as regular cigarettes, such as age limits, and they are no longer allowed to have any flavors. "They cannot have any distinctive taste," Paaso said, adding, "our approach is this basic idea to phase out all nicotine products."
The use of flavors in e-cigarettes has been the subject of much debate, amid fears that they will entice young people toward the habit and act as a gateway into smoking.
"That's absolutely crucial," said Harvard's Rees, who believes that e-cigarettes can be a useful tool to help people quit smoking and advocates the UK's stance on harm reduction. But his support ends when flavors are involved. "We're seeing a proliferation in flavors, including gummy bear and candy flavors that are intrinsically appealing to children."
A global mission?
Finland is not alone in wanting to reduce smoking and all tobacco-related habits among its population.
Henning and Rees highlight Australia, where plain packaging on cigarette boxes in combination with taxation has helped bring numbers down rapidly. In 2014-15, just 14.7% of adults 18 or over smoked daily -- less than than Finland -- compared with more than 16% in 2011-12.
"They increased the price dramatically, and we're now seeing a benefit," Rees said. 
On the other end of the spectrum lies China. After a surge in demand for tobacco products in recent years as more people took up smoking, three cities have banned smoking indoors in public places, including the capital, Beijing.
"Tobacco-related deaths are rising because male smoking rates are so high," Henning said. More than 1.3 million people die each year of tobacco-related disease in China, according to the Tobacco Atlas, linked to the fact that more than 45% of men are smokers. "We're optimistic that these cities are going to lead the way."
On a global level, the WHO set a goal to reduce tobacco use among people over the age of 15 by 30% by 2025, to fit in line with goals to reduce rates of non-communicable disease, like cancer, as a result.
But Finland remains a pioneer, the first country to set a goal to end the problem in its entirety. Experts, as well as the government, believe they can make it happen.
"Governments should set themselves that goal of achieving exactly that," Rees said. But he acknowledges that not all countries would necessarily be able to achieve it, with culture playing a key role. "Finland, having a much more control over a relatively homogenous population, can realistically set that goal."
And Henning agrees that simply setting a target can make a difference. "It's a long shot," she said. "But Finland believes it's achievable."

First human-pig embryos made, then destroyed 
Set edition preference:Set edition preference:Set edition preference:By Susan Scutti, CNNUpdated 12:11 PM ET, Mon January 30, 2017 Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. (CNN)To grow human organs within animal bodies has long been the dream of scientists wanting to provide transplantable hearts, lungs, kidneys and other organs for patients in need. A glimpse of possible success in this elusive goal was seen Thursday.See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.Using stem cell technologies, researchers generated human cells and human tissues in the embryos of pigs and cattle. Their research appeared in the journal Cell. 
Despite this milestone, integrating cells from human and animal species is proving difficult, and developing human organs remains at a considerable distance, said Dr. Jun Wu, a staff scientist in the gene expression laboratory at the Salk Institute and first author of the research.
"Species evolve independently, and many factors dictating the developmental programs might have diverged, which makes it difficult to blend cells from one species to a developing embryo from another," Wu said. "The larger the evolutionary distance, the more difficult for them to mix."
Or as senior author Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte, a professor in Salk's gene expression laboratory, sees it, "To try to imitate nature is not that easy."
Building block experiments
The project began with the research team attempting to prove that it could grow one animal's organ cells within a different species of animal. This is known as a chimera -- specifically an interspecies chimera, an organism containing cells from two or more species. 
They began with two closely related species: rats and mice. 
To create a rat-mouse chimera, the scientists began by creating a mouse embryo without a pancreas. 
Similar work had been done before by other scientists, notably Hiromitsu Nakauchi, now at Stanford, who bred mutant mice that lacked a pancreas and then grew a rat pancreas inside a mouse.  
In the current study, Belmonte, Wu and their colleagues used gene-editing techniques known as CRISPR/Cas9 to generate mice embryos lacking a pancreas. Then they inserted rat stem cells that contained a gene for the pancreas into these mutant embryos. 
Once implanted, the stem cells developed into a rat pancreas within a mouse embryo that ultimately (and importantly) grew into a healthy mouse with a normal lifespan. Taking their idea a few steps further, the researchers used the same method to develop rat eyes and rat hearts within mice embryos.
"We demonstrated the robustness of this system," Wu said. By "genetically disabling" the mouse host, they proved it was possible to generate rat organs within a host species. 
Unexpectedly to the researchers, the mice delivered bonus organs after the injection of rat stem cells: gallbladders, which are present in mice but not in rats. 
"This suggests that rats lack a gallbladder not because of an inherent genetic deficiency of rat cells," Wu said.  Instead, "embryonic niches" may be orchestrating the tissues and organs that develop and grow within each animal species. 
After the rat-mice experiments, the team turned its focus to human stem cells.
Small but significant
They began by generating different types of human induced pluripotent stem cells -- when adult cells are turned back into stem cells -- and inserting them into pig embryos. Pigs were used because both the size and the development time for their organs are more similar to our own than, say, rats. 
Next, the team members implanted these embryos into sows. To test the safety and effectiveness of their work, they stopped the experiment at four weeks.
Human cells within some of the embryos had begun to specialize and turn into tissue precursors, they discovered. However, the success rate and level of human stem cell contributions in pigs was much lower than with the rat-mouse chimeras. 
Wu cautioned that the research is in its very early stages, and with many challenges ahead, the development of human organs within animals may not be possible for some time. 
Though the experiment with human stem cells was interrupted at 28 days, it remains the first reported case in which human stem cells have begun to grow within another species. So it is a small but significant step toward the ultimate goal of growing human organs in animals, said Insoo Hyun, an associate professor of bioethics and philosophy at Case Western Reserve University. 
"They just wanted to see if the cells would survive during gestation, and they did, and they kind of migrated here and there to various sites, except the brain, which is interesting," said Hyun, who was not involved in the research. 
Hyun, who worked on developing international guidelines for the International Society for Stem Cell Research, said the Salk Institute researchers appear to be staying within international ethical boundaries.
"The next step would be then to see if they can get better at localizing where the human cells develop and, ideally, getting to organ genesis," he noted. 
Ethical concerns
"The interesting thing is, it was not funded by American taxpayer money," Hyun said, at least not directly. The primary funding came from private Spanish sources.
One reason for this is the US National Institutes of Health examined chimera science in a 2015 workshop and "accompanied that with a pause" on funding of a "very narrow subset of animal human chimera research," said Carrie D. Wolinetz, the institutes' associate director for science policy. 
This subset consists of scientists introducing human cells into animal embryos at a very early stage.
"There has been the use of human-animal chimeras in biomedical research for a very long time. We've introduced human cells into animal models to create models of human diseases and used them as research tools for decades now," Wolinetz said. 
"But over time, what we've seen -- as stem cell technology has advanced and as gene editing technology has advanced -- we've seen the ability to create more sophisticated animal-human chimeras at a much earlier stage of embryonic development," she said.
The reason, then, the National Institutes of Health suspended funding was over ethical concerns. 
The chimeras used in biomedical research have been created, typically, by putting the human cells in at a later stage of development: at the fetal stage or even after birth. At these stages, scientists have a lot more control in that the cells stay where they are put, and they don't "drift all over" the animal's body, explained Wolinetz.
In these new experiments, human cells are being introduced at a much earlier stage of development, when the cells are still sorting themselves out within the embryo. 
"In particular, people were concerned about human cells populating the brain of the animal or the germline of the animal," Wolinetz said. In the first case, the animal might be humanized; in the second case, the animal might pass human genes on to its offspring.
As Hyun frames it, the ethical question is this: "If you up the biological contribution of the human stem cells, are you also somehow turning them morally into a human-like thing with human rights?"  He noted, though, "It's so difficult to know how you would actually address that." It's not measurable. 
"I would argue, as long as you are avoiding the brain, or there's not a significant change to the brain, of structure and possible functioning, then I don't think you even need to go down that philosophical path," he said. Though as a philosopher, it might be "fun" for him, it's not a wise or practical thing to do for policy.
Instead, Hyun said, you want to stick with measurable criteria such as seeing a drop in animal function from the beginning of an experiment to the end. "The emphasis should still remain on animal welfare," he said, as it is currently for any kind of animal research.
Meanwhile, Wolinetz said the National Institutes of Health is hoping to finalize its policy on chimera research very soon in order to get back into the business of funding appropriate projects.
"We would like to make sure exciting research can go forward," she said, "but also make sure that we've got an appropriate oversight system so we can make sure it's proceeding responsibly."

Donald Trump to speak with Vladimir Putin on Saturday
By Jeff Zeleny and James Griffiths, CNNUpdated 9:05 PM ET, Fri January 27, 2017 Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. (CNN)President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are scheduled to speak on the phone Saturday in their first conversation since Trump took office, with Vice President Mike Pence joining the call.Trump has vowed to have better relations with Russia than his predecessor. 
This month, he suggested he would lift sanctions imposed by the Obama administration if the Kremlin helps the US battle terrorists.  
In his new year's message, Putin congratulated Trump and expressed hope their two countries would be able to "take their interaction in the international arena to a whole new level." 
"Major global and regional challenges that our countries have confronted in recent years clearly confirm that Russia-US relations are an important factor in ensuring stability and security in the modern world," Putin said. 
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov this week called for the "re-establishment of normal relations" between Russia and the United States under the Trump administration. 
"Following the difficult relations we had under Barack Obama, President Putin is ready to meet in the interests of global security and stability," Lavrov said.
New leaf
Tensions between the US and Russia are at their highest in years, after the Obama administration accused the Kremlin of interfering in the 2016 election, imposing sanctions and ejecting diplomats. 
Trump has been accused by his critics of being too close to Russia, and both he and Obama were briefed on an unverified dossier containing allegations that Russian operatives possessed compromising information on Trump. 
Some 4,000 US soldiers have also been deployed to eastern Europe as part of troop rotations the Pentagon said are intended to bolster ties with NATO allies and send a message to Russia. 
There is therefore great scope for Trump to improve relations between Washington and the Kremlin, as he has expressed a desire to do.
This week, however, UK Prime Minister Theresa May advised caution when dealing with Russia, ahead of her meeting Friday with Trump. 
"With President Putin, my advice is to engage, but beware," she said. 
"We should engage with Russia from a position of strength and build the relationship, systems, and processes that make cooperation more likely than conflict."

Full text of Trump's executive order on 7-nation ban, refugee suspension
Updated 9:08 AM ET, Sat January 28, 2017 Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. (CNN)President Donald Trump on Friday banned nationals of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States for at least the next 90 days by executive order.IranIraqSyriaSudanLibyaYemenSomalia134 million banned from USWhat the ban says: The full textAll of Trump's executive orders, memos and proclamationsWill the orders and actions stick?How Trump's actions stack up against previous presidentsThe order bars all people hailing from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. Those countries were named in  a 2016 law concerning immigration visas as "countries of concern."
The executive order also bans entry of those fleeing from war-torn Syria indefinitely. 
Trump also has stopped the admission of all refugees to the United States for four months.
The order also calls for a review into suspending the Visa Interview Waiver Program, which allows travelers from 38 countries -- including close allies -- to renew travel authorizations without an in-person interview.
Here is the order in its entirety: 
PROTECTING THE NATION FROM FOREIGN TERRORIST ENTRY INTO THE UNITED STATES
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and laws of the United States of America, including the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq., and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and to protect the American people from terrorist attacks by foreign nationals admitted to the United States, it is hereby ordered as follows:
Section 1.  Purpose.  The visa-issuance process plays a crucial role in detecting individuals with terrorist ties and stopping them from entering the United States.  Perhaps in no instance was that more apparent than the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, when State Department policy prevented consular officers from properly scrutinizing the visa applications of several of the 19 foreign nationals who went on to murder nearly 3,000 Americans.  And while the visa-issuance process was reviewed and amended after the September 11 attacks to better detect would-be terrorists from receiving visas, these measures did not stop attacks by foreign nationals who were admitted to the United States.
Numerous foreign-born individuals have been convicted or implicated in terrorism-related crimes since September 11, 2001, including foreign nationals who entered the United States after receiving visitor, student, or employment visas, or who entered through the United States refugee resettlement program. Deteriorating conditions in certain countries due to war, strife, disaster, and civil unrest increase the likelihood that terrorists will use any means possible to enter the United States.  The United States must be vigilant during the visa-issuance process to ensure that those approved for admission do not intend to harm Americans and that they have no ties to terrorism.
In order to protect Americans, the United States must ensure that those admitted to this country do not bear hostile attitudes toward it and its founding principles.  The United States cannot, and should not, admit those who do not support the Constitution, or those who would place violent ideologies over American law.  In addition, the United States should not admit those who engage in acts of bigotry or hatred (including "honor" killings, other forms of violence against women, or the persecution of those who practice religions different from their own) or those who would oppress Americans of any race, gender, or sexual orientation.
Sec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the United States to protect its citizens from foreign nationals who intend to commit terrorist attacks in the United States; and to prevent the admission of foreign nationals who intend to exploit United States immigration laws for malevolent purposes.
Sec. 3. Suspension of Issuance of Visas and Other Immigration Benefits to Nationals of Countries of Particular Concern.  (a)  The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence, shall immediately conduct a review to determine the information needed from any country to adjudicate any visa, admission, or other benefit under the INA (adjudications) in order to determine that the individual seeking the benefit is who the individual claims to be and is not a security or public-safety threat.
(b)  The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence, shall submit to the President a report on the results of the review described in subsection (a) of this section, including the Secretary of Homeland Security's determination of the information needed for adjudications and a list of countries that do not provide adequate information, within 30 days of the date of this order.  The Secretary of Homeland Security shall provide a copy of the report to the Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence.
(c)  To temporarily reduce investigative burdens on relevant agencies during the review period described in subsection (a) of this section, to ensure the proper review and maximum utilization of available resources for the screening of foreign nationals, and to ensure that adequate standards are established to prevent infiltration by foreign terrorists or criminals, pursuant to section 212(f) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f), I hereby proclaim that the immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of aliens from countries referred to in section 217(a)(12) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1187(a)(12), would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and I hereby suspend entry into the United States, as immigrants and nonimmigrants, of such persons for 90 days from the date of this order (excluding those foreign nationals traveling on diplomatic visas, North Atlantic Treaty Organization visas, C-2 visas for travel to the United Nations, and G-1, G-2, G-3, and G-4 visas).
(d)  Immediately upon receipt of the report described in subsection (b) of this section regarding the information needed for adjudications, the Secretary of State shall request all foreign governments that do not supply such information to start providing such information regarding their nationals within 60 days of notification.
(e)  After the 60-day period described in subsection (d) of this section expires, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State, shall submit to the President a list of countries recommended for inclusion on a Presidential proclamation that would prohibit the entry of foreign nationals (excluding those foreign nationals traveling on diplomatic visas, North Atlantic Treaty Organization visas, C-2 visas for travel to the United Nations, and G-1, G-2, G-3, and G-4 visas) from countries that do not provide the information requested pursuant to subsection (d) of this section until compliance occurs.
(f)  At any point after submitting the list described in subsection (e) of this section, the Secretary of State or the Secretary of Homeland Security may submit to the President the names of any additional countries recommended for similar treatment.
 (g)  Notwithstanding a suspension pursuant to subsection (c) of this section or pursuant to a Presidential proclamation described in subsection (e) of this section, the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security may, on a case-by-case basis, and when in the national interest, issue visas or other immigration benefits to nationals of countries for which visas and benefits are otherwise blocked.
(h)  The Secretaries of State and Homeland Security shall submit to the President a joint report on the progress in implementing this order within 30 days of the date of this order, a second report within 60 days of the date of this order, a third report within 90 days of the date of this order, and a fourth report within 120 days of the date of this order.
Sec. 4. Implementing Uniform Screening Standards for All Immigration Programs.  (a)  The Secretary of State, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Director of National Intelligence, and the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation shall implement a program, as part of the adjudication process for immigration benefits, to identify individuals seeking to enter the United States on a fraudulent basis with the intent to cause harm, or who are at risk of causing harm subsequent to their admission. This program will include the development of a uniform screening standard and procedure, such as in-person interviews; a database of identity documents proffered by applicants to ensure that duplicate documents are not used by multiple applicants; amended application forms that include questions aimed at identifying fraudulent answers and malicious intent; a mechanism to ensure that the applicant is who the applicant claims to be; a process to evaluate the applicant's likelihood of becoming a positively contributing member of society and the applicant's ability to make contributions to the national interest; and a mechanism to assess whether or not the applicant has the intent to commit criminal or terrorist acts after entering the United States.
(b)  The Secretary of Homeland Security, in conjunction with the Secretary of State, the Director of National Intelligence, and the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, shall submit to the President an initial report on the progress of this directive within 60 days of the date of this order, a second report within 100 days of the date of this order, and a third report within 200 days of the date of this order.
Sec. 5. Realignment of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program for Fiscal Year 2017.  (a)  The Secretary of State shall suspend the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) for 120 days.  During the 120-day period, the Secretary of State, in conjunction with the Secretary of Homeland Security and in consultation with the Director of National Intelligence, shall review the USRAP application and adjudication process to determine what additional procedures should be taken to ensure that those approved for refugee admission do not pose a threat to the security and welfare of the United States, and shall implement such additional procedures.  Refugee applicants who are already in the USRAP process may be admitted upon the initiation and completion of these revised procedures.  Upon the date that is 120 days after the date of this order, the Secretary of State shall resume USRAP admissions only for nationals of countries for which the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Director of National Intelligence have jointly determined that such additional procedures are adequate to ensure the security and welfare of the United States.
(b)  Upon the resumption of USRAP admissions, the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, is further directed to make changes, to the extent permitted by law, to prioritize refugee claims made by individuals on the basis of religious-based persecution, provided that the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individual's country of nationality.  Where necessary and appropriate, the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security shall recommend legislation to the President that would assist with such prioritization.
(c)  Pursuant to section 212(f) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f), I hereby proclaim that the entry of nationals of Syria as refugees is detrimental to the interests of the United States and thus suspend any such entry until such time as I have determined that sufficient changes have been made to the USRAP to ensure that admission of Syrian refugees is consistent with the national interest. 
(d)  Pursuant to section 212(f) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f), I hereby proclaim that the entry of more than 50,000 refugees in fiscal year 2017 would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and thus suspend any such entry until such time as I determine that additional admissions would be in the national interest.
(e)  Notwithstanding the temporary suspension imposed pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security may jointly determine to admit individuals to the United States as refugees on a case-by-case basis, in their discretion, but only so long as they determine that the admission of such individuals as refugees is in the national interest -- including when the person is a religious minority in his country of nationality facing religious persecution, when admitting the person would enable the United States to conform its conduct to a preexisting international agreement, or when the person is already in transit and denying admission would cause undue hardship -- and it would not pose a risk to the security or welfare of the United States. 
(f)  The Secretary of State shall submit to the President an initial report on the progress of the directive in subsection (b) of this section regarding prioritization of claims made by individuals on the basis of religious-based persecution within 100 days of the date of this order and shall submit a second report within 200 days of the date of this order. 
(g)  It is the policy of the executive branch that, to the extent permitted by law and as practicable, State and local jurisdictions be granted a role in the process of determining the placement or settlement in their jurisdictions of aliens eligible to be admitted to the United States as refugees.  To that end, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall examine existing law to determine the extent to which, consistent with applicable law, State and local jurisdictions may have greater involvement in the process of determining the placement or resettlement of refugees in their jurisdictions, and shall devise a proposal to lawfully promote such involvement.
Sec. 6. Rescission of Exercise of Authority Relating to the Terrorism Grounds of Inadmissibility.  The Secretaries of State and Homeland Security shall, in consultation with the Attorney General, consider rescinding the exercises of authority in section 212 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182, relating to the terrorism grounds of inadmissibility, as well as any related implementing memoranda.
Sec. 7. Expedited Completion of the Biometric Entry-Exit Tracking System.  (a)  The Secretary of Homeland Security shall expedite the completion and implementation of a biometric entry-exit tracking system for all travelers to the United States, as recommended by the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States.
(b)  The Secretary of Homeland Security shall submit to the President periodic reports on the progress of the directive contained in subsection (a) of this section.  The initial report shall be submitted within 100 days of the date of this order, a second report shall be submitted within 200 days of the date of this order, and a third report shall be submitted within 365 days of the date of this order.  Further, the Secretary shall submit a report every 180 days thereafter until the system is fully deployed and operational.
Sec. 8. Visa Interview Security.  (a)  The Secretary of State shall immediately suspend the Visa Interview Waiver Program and ensure compliance with section 222 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1222, which requires that all individuals seeking a nonimmigrant visa undergo an in-person interview, subject to specific statutory exceptions.
(b)  To the extent permitted by law and subject to the availability of appropriations, the Secretary of State shall immediately expand the Consular Fellows Program, including by substantially increasing the number of Fellows, lengthening or making permanent the period of service, and making language training at the Foreign Service Institute available to Fellows for assignment to posts outside of their area of core linguistic ability, to ensure that non-immigrant visa-interview wait times are not unduly affected.
Sec. 9.  Visa Validity Reciprocity.  The Secretary of State shall review all nonimmigrant visa reciprocity agreements to ensure that they are, with respect to each visa classification, truly reciprocal insofar as practicable with respect to validity period and fees, as required by sections 221(c) and 281 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1201(c) and 1351, and other treatment.  If a country does not treat United States nationals seeking nonimmigrant visas in a reciprocal manner, the Secretary of State shall adjust the visa validity period, fee schedule, or other treatment to match the treatment of United States nationals by the foreign country, to the extent practicable.
Sec. 10. Transparency and Data Collection.  (a)  To be more transparent with the American people, and to more effectively implement policies and practices that serve the national interest, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Attorney General, shall, consistent with applicable law and national security, collect and make publicly available within 180 days, and every 180 days thereafter:
(i)   information regarding the number of foreign nationals in the United States who have been charged with terrorism-related offenses while in the United States; convicted of terrorism-related offenses while in the United States; or removed from the United States based on terrorism-related activity, affiliation, or material support to a terrorism-related organization, or any other national security reasons since the date of this order or the last reporting period, whichever is later;
(ii)   information regarding the number of foreign nationals in the United States who have been radicalized after entry into the United States and engaged in terrorism-related acts, or who have provided material support to terrorism-related organizations in countries that pose a threat to the United States, since the date of this order or the last reporting period, whichever is later; and
(iii)  information regarding the number and types of acts of gender-based violence against women, including honor killings, in the United States by foreign nationals, since the date of this order or the last reporting period, whichever is later; and
(iv)   any other information relevant to public safety and security as determined by the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Attorney General, including information on the immigration status of foreign nationals charged with major offenses.
(b)  The Secretary of State shall, within one year of the date of this order, provide a report on the estimated long-term costs of the USRAP at the Federal, State, and local levels.
Sec. 11. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:
(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or
(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.
(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
DONALD J. TRUMPTHE WHITE HOUSE, January 27, 2017
http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/26/politics/top-state-department-officials-asked-to-leave-by-trump-administration/&sa=U&ved=0ahUKEwjUgb7RlPXRAhUE-GMKHdo2BWA4bhCpAggrKAAwBw&usg=AFQjCNHwJDnRkj_QOAamnVuEr4qjubhLTA
Trump administration asks top State Department officials to leave
By Elise Labott, CNNUpdated 8:56 AM ET, Fri January 27, 2017 Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.Washington (CNN)Two senior administration officials said Thursday that the Trump administration told four top State Department management officials that their services were no longer needed as part of an effort to "clean house" at Foggy Bottom. Patrick Kennedy, who served for nine years as the undersecretary for management, Assistant Secretaries for Administration and Consular Affairs Joyce Anne Barr and Michele Bond, and Ambassador Gentry Smith, director of the Office for Foreign Missions, were sent letters by the White House that their service was no longer required, the sources told CNN. 
All four, career officers serving in positions appointed by the President, submitted letters of resignation per tradition at the beginning of a new administration.
Mexican president cancels meeting with Trump
The letters from the White House said that their resignations were accepted and they were thanked for their service. 
The White House usually asks career officials in such positions to stay on for a few months until their successors are confirmed.
"Any implication that that these four people quit is wrong," one senior State Department official said. "These people are loyal to the secretary, the President and to the State Department. There is just not any attempt here to dis the President. People are not quitting and running away in disgust. This is the White House cleaning house."
Mark Toner, the State Department's acting spokesman, said in a statement that "These positions are political appointments, and require the President to nominate and the Senate to confirm them in these roles. They are not career appointments but of limited term."
He continued, "Of the officers whose resignations were accepted, some will continue in the Foreign Service in other positions, and others will retire by choice or because they have exceeded the time limits of their grade in service."
Greg Starr, director of diplomatic security, also followed through on his planned resignation. He had come back from retirement after the 2012 attack on the US consulate in Benghazi and promised to stay through the end of the Obama administration.
"This had been on course for over a year," another official said. "He came out of retirement and promised to stay out (of) the administration. If Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders were elected, he would still be retiring."
Trump trade deal moves could hurt US security posture
The firings leave a huge management hole at the State Department, with a combined 150 years of institutional experience among all of the named officials. The second official echoed that the move appeared to be an effort by the new administration to "clean house" among the State Department's top leadership.
Victoria Nuland, the State Department's assistant secretary for Europe, left on her own. 
"The department will not collapse," the second official said. "Everyone has good deputies. It's a huge institutional loss, but  the department has excellent subordinates and the career people will step up. They will take up the responsibility."
In her parting letter, Bond told her colleagues, "It has been an honor to serve with you as the Assistant Secretary for the past 17 months, and to have represented the United States as a Foreign Service officer for 40 years. What a privilege it has been."
The American Foreign Service Association indicated in a statement that it sees many worthy career State Department employees as suitable replacements. "The skills that are needed for these positions are exceedingly rare outside the Foreign Service. Given the talent available in our diplomatic corps, we expect that the new secretary will have no trouble finding the right people at State to fill out his senior leadership team," the group said.
Correction: An earlier version of this story mischaracterized Victoria Nuland's departure. She left on her own.

Mexican president cancels meeting with Trump
By Daniella Diaz, CNNUpdated 9:40 AM ET, Fri January 27, 2017 Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.Washington (CNN)Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto on Thursday canceled a meeting with US President Donald Trump that had been set for next week after renewed tensions erupted over Trump's plan to build a wall on the border.The U.S. has a 60 billion dollar trade deficit with Mexico. It has been a one-sided deal from the beginning of NAFTA with massive numbers...of jobs and companies lost. If Mexico is unwilling to pay for the badly needed wall, then it would be better to cancel the upcoming meeting.CNN's Mary Kay Mallonee contributed to this report.  "This morning we have informed the White House that I will not attend the meeting scheduled for next Tuesday with the POTUS," Peña Nieto tweeted.
Earlier Thursday morning, Trump had tweeted that it would be better to skip the meeting if Peña Nieto continued to insist Mexico would not pay for the wall -- something the Mexican leader had said as recently as Wednesday evening. 
"If Mexico is unwilling to pay for the badly needed wall, then it would be better to cancel the upcoming meeting," Trump tweeted and in an earlier tweet he noted the US's trade deficit with Mexico and what he said were the American job losses caused by NAFTA.
Trump spoke about the cancellation during remarks at a gathering of congressional Republicans in Philadelphia. 
Trump said that he and the Mexican president had mutually agreed to scrap their planned get together, and he repeated his position that the US won't fund the wall.
"Unless Mexico will treat the US fairly, with respect, such a meeting is fruitless, and I want to go a different route," Trump told House and Senate GOP lawmakers. "I have no choice."
"Border security is a serious, serious issue and a national problem," Trump said. "Most illegal immigration is coming from our Southern border."
On Wednesday night, Peña Nieto had said at that time he did not see a need to scrap the get together -- but he strongly reiterated that his country wouldn't fund any border wall, which Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell said Thursday would cost $12-$15 billion. 
"President Trump's insistence that Mexico will pay for the wall has once again just been proven as delusional fiction by the Mexican President," said House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. "The wall is a multi-billion dollar boondoggle in the making, and Republicans should be embarrassed about their brazen hypocrisy in enabling it."
"Mexico does not believe in walls. I've said time again; Mexico will not pay for any wall," the Mexican president said in a video statement posted to Twitter and translated by CNN from Spanish.
The back-and-forth between the two leaders began last year during the first days of the Trump campaign when he called some Mexicans entering the US criminals and rapists and tensions lingered throughout the 2016 contest. They escalated sharply over the last 24 hours when Trump took executive action on Wednesday to begin the process of erecting a wall.
The President announced that move while a high-level Mexican delegation was visiting the White House -- the first foreign representatives to come since Trump took office -- for meetings with top officials, including Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and adviser Jared Kushner. 
One member of the delegation, Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray, who had led talks between his government and the Trump transition team, was in his car on his way to meetings at the Department of Homeland Security on Thursday when he suddenly decided he would not attend.
"We will work to schedule a future meeting and will continue to keep the lines of communication and partnership open," said DHS Spokeswoman Gillian Christensen.
In his video address, Peña Nieto also said he had ordered government agencies to step up protection for immigrants.
"I've asked for the minister of Foreign Relations to re-enforce protection measures to our citizens," he said. He added that the 50 Mexican consulates in the US will be used to defend the rights of immigrants in the country and issued a call to action to legislators and civic organizations to help immigrants.
Mexican delegation brings 'Mexico First' message
Peña Nieto closed his message by saying Mexico offers and expects respect. "Mexico offers its friendship to the people of the United States and expresses its wish to arrive at agreements with its government, deals that will be in favor of Mexico and the Mexicans," he said.
Earlier Wednesday, Trump signed two executive orders directing construction of a wall on the US-Mexico border, boosting border patrol forces, and increasing the number of immigration enforcement officers who carry out deportations.
Meanwhile, the Mexican officials who arrived Wednesday had been expected to lay the groundwork for Peña Nieto's visit next week, which Mexican diplomats had seen as an important opportunity to try to move past the anti-Mexico rhetoric Trump used during the campaign and a chance to put the relationship back on track.
"There is ... frustration with our government and ourselves that we have not been able to tell the story of this important relationship," a Mexican diplomat told CNN ahead of the delegation's visit. "There are a lot of stereotypes of Mexicans in the US, but there are also stereotypes of Americans in Mexico. It is in the interest of both governments to explain what this relationship is and what we can do together."
Related: Reality Check: Illegal immigration has plummeted
In a Monday speech, Peña Nieto said his government is prepared to negotiate with the US if Mexico's national sovereignty is respected. He laid out economic integration and respect for the rights of migrants and the money they send home as his nation's key negotiating points.
"Neither confrontation nor submission. Dialogue is the solution," Peña Nieto said.
Trump has suggested some of the $25 billion in annual remittances that migrants return home would be retained to pay for the border wall.
Trump flew to Mexico City during his campaign to meet Peña Nieto and said they discussed a wall Trump has vowed to build on the US southern border, but not his demand that Mexico pay for it -- an assertion the Mexican president later disputed.
"At the start of the conversation with Donald Trump, I made it clear that Mexico will not pay for the wall," Peña Nieto tweeted, after their meeting, which was widely viewed as a public relations disaster for Peña Nieto.

Mary Tyler Moore, beloved TV actress, dies at 80
By Lisa Respers France, CNNUpdated 12:22 AM ET, Thu January 26, 2017 Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. (CNN)Actress Mary Tyler Moore, whose eponymous 1970s series helped usher in a new era for women on television, died Wednesday at the age of 80, her longtime representative Mara Buxbaum said.#marytylermoore my heart goes out to you and your family. Know that I love you and believe in your strength.I'm deep in regret about the passing of Mary Tyler Moore. What an actress. What a woman. What a person. Always gracious, filled w/good humor"Who can turn the world on with her smile..." #MaryTylerMoore may she rest.© 2017 Cable News Network. Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. All Rights Reserved.CNN Sans ™ & © 2017 Cable News Network. "Today beloved icon Mary Tyler Moore passed away at the age of 80 in the company of friends and her loving husband of over 33 years, Dr. S. Robert Levine," she said. "A groundbreaking actress, producer, and passionate advocate for the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, Mary will be remembered as a fearless visionary who turned the world on with her smile."
"The Mary Tyler Moore Show"  debuted in 1970 and starred the actress as Mary Richards, a single 30-something career woman at a Minneapolis TV station. The series was hailed by feminists and fans alike as the first modern woman's sitcom.
But that wasn't the role which catapulted her into stardom. Moore first found fame playing Laura Petrie, the wife on the "The Dick Van Dyke Show," which ran for five seasons beginning in 1961.
In an interview with Conan O'Brien, show creator Carl Reiner said he auditioned more than two dozen actresses before Moore's reading marked her as the only one who could play Laura. 
"I grabbed the top of her head and I said 'Come with me,'" Reiner told O'Brien. "I walked her down the hall to [Show producer Sheldon Leonard] and said, 'I found her!'"
Hollywood mourned her loss on Wednesday.
"My heart goes out to you and your family. Know that I love you and believe in your strength," said former co-star Ed Asner on Twitter.
"Mary Tyler Moore changed the world for all women. I send my love to her family," tweeted Ellen DeGeneres. 
Moore was born in 1936 in Brooklyn, New York, to clerk George Tyler Moore and his wife, Marjorie.
When she was still a young girl the family, which included her two younger siblings, moved to Los Angeles. Moore would later reveal that her mother was an alcoholic, which caused the household to be chaotic.
Moore began her career as a dancer and in the 1950s landed a gig as dancing elf Happy Hotpoint, on a series of Hotpoint appliances TV commercials which ran during "The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet" television show.
Her dancer legs led to her being cast as Sam, the sexy answering service girl, on the TV show "Richard Diamond, Private Detective "in 1957. Moore's legs were shown, but never her face.
Fans would come to love that face on "The Dick Van Dyke Show," and Moore quickly was dubbed America's sweetheart. 
The role earned her two Emmys.
After that show ended in 1966, Moore looked to working more on the big screen, including opposite Elvis Presley in the 1969 film "Change of Habit."
'The Mary Tyler Moore Show' years
The next year "The Mary Tyler Moore Show" premiered. The opening sequence, featuring Moore twirling and tossing her cap, became iconic. The show ended in 1977, but spurred several spinoffs, including "Rhoda," and "The Lou Grant Show." 
In a 2002 interview with CNN's Larry King, Moore explained why she believed the series became so popular.
"I think I can take responsibility for that in that I was the audience," she said. "I was the voice of sanity around whom all these crazies did their dance. And I reacted in the same way that a member of the audience would have reacted."
In real life, Moore was not a single woman. In 1955, she married Richard Carleton Meeker and the following year gave birth to their son, Richard Jr.
The couple divorced in 1961 and the following year she married CBS executive Grant Tinker.
While their union didn't produce any children, it did give birth to television production company MTM Enterprises, which produced "The Mary Tyler Moore Show" as well as such acclaimed series as "The Bob Newhart Show," "Hill Street Blues" and "St. Elsewhere."
Moore and Tinker divorced in 1981, a year after her son died after accidentally shooting himself while handling a shotgun.
She said problems with alcohol helped to contribute to the demise of her marriage to Tinker.
"We would have inane arguments over dinner about things I couldn't remember the next day," Moore told the National Ledger. "Alcoholism brings to the fore hostilities and resentment -- you can't have a marriage like that."
Love again, and an Oscar nod
In 1983, Moore married Dr. Robert Levine.
While she was beloved as a comedic actress, Moore also found success in dramas.
Critics praised her against-type performance as a chilly mother whose family grapples with the accidental death of a son in Robert Redford's 1980 film "Ordinary People," for which Moore was nominated for an Oscar.
She worked in theater and periodically appeared on TV shows in recent years, including "Hot in Cleveland," where she was reunited with "The Mary Tyler Moore Show" co-stars Betty White and Valerie Harper. 
Moore was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes in her 30s and had numerous health issues over the years, including complications from that disease and brain surgery to remove a meningioma tumor in 2011.
