Pelosi: 'white supremacist' Bannon making America 'less safe'
By Deirdre Walsh, CNN Senior Congressional ProducerUpdated 5:39 PM ET, Fri February 3, 2017 Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.Washington (CNN)House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi Thursday called the appointment of Steve Bannon, the President's chief strategist to the National Security Council "stunning," and referred to him twice as "white supremacist." "It's a stunning thing, that a white supremacist would be a permanent member of the National Security Council," Pelosi said at her weekly news conference.
The move is "making America less safe," the California Democrat added.
The Democratic National Committee doubled down on that criticism Friday, labeling Bannon Trump's "white supremacist chief strategist" in an email and asking recipients to demand his resignation.
Pelosi has been critical of early moves by the Trump administration, but she also Thursday seemed to raise question about the President's fitness for the job.
She brought up a proposal that House Oversight Chairman Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, was reportedly considering that would require an independent medical assessment of the condition of the President, including mental health. 
"If you're going to have your hands on the nuclear codes, you probably -- we should probably know what mental state you're in," Pelosi said. 
"I can't wait until he introduces that legislation, to be able to join him as cosponsor of that," telling reporters, "I think it's a very good idea."
When asked about her early overtures to Trump -- attending the inauguration and expressing willingness to work with the new President -- Pelosi cautioned reporters: "Please don't mistake courtesy for approval or anything else positive." 
Pelosi repeated her vow that she and her party would fight the Republican effort to dismantle the health care law. She criticized the administration's decision to stop paying for advertisements ahead of the Obamacare enrollment deadline and predicted about the Republican effort to do away with the law. 
"This will lead to suffering, death, disability," Pelosi said.

Brexit: Government reveals plans for UK's exit from EU
Set edition preference:Set edition preference:Set edition preference:By Laura Smith-Spark, Angela Dewan and James Masters, CNNUpdated 3:13 AM ET, Fri February 3, 2017 Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.London (CNN)The British government formally set out details for the first time Thursday of its strategy for Britain's departure from the European Union.CNN's David Wilkinson contributed to this report.The 77-page "white paper" was published a day after lawmakers voted overwhelmingly in favor of a bill that once finalized would give May the authority to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty -- the formal process of leaving the EU.
It contained few clues about the government's overall strategy that were not evident in a speech delivered by Prime Minister Theresa May in January. But it fleshed out aspects of May's plan in some key areas.
The white paper said: 
• The UK will seek a "new strategic partnership" with Europe. While the UK would leave the EU single market and  customs union, it would seek to keep "elements" of the free-trade zone. 
• No "cliff-edge" Brexit. The government said it would seek transitional arrangements to minimize the impact of Britain's departure front he EU.
• Early targets for trade deals would be the US, China, Brazil, Australia, New Zealand, India and states in the Persian Gulf. It would seek "continuity" of arrangements with other countries that are currently covered by EU deals.
• The government hopes for an "early" agreement on the status of the 2.8 million EU nationals who live in the UK. It expressed disappointment that a number of EU states had blocked attempts to sort the issue out before formal divorce talks begin.
• It offered no guarantee on the status of the Irish border. The government said only that it would "aim" to protect the common travel area that exists between Northern Ireland, which is part of the UK, and the Republic of Ireland, which will remain in the EU. The issue is a key part of the deal that brought peace to Northern Ireland. 
In a foreword to the white paper, May said Britain approached the negotiations anticipating success, not failure.
"The House of Commons has voted overwhelmingly for us to get on with it. And the overwhelming majority of people -- however they voted -- want us to get on with it too," she said. 
David Davis, the Secretary of State for Exiting the EU, told the House of Commons that Britain wanted the "European Union to succeed, politically and economically" and so would approach the negotiations in the "spirit of goodwill" and for both sides' mutual benefit. 
Immigration: 'Nobody will be thrown out'
Around 2.8 million EU nationals live in the UK, many of them Polish. Around 1 million UK nationals live in other member states, 300,000 of them in Spain. 
Resolving the status of both groups was an "early priority", the white paper said. It indicated frustration with other EU states that it had not already been dealt with. "The government would have liked to resolve this issue ahead of formal negotiations," it said.
While welcoming the contribution of migrants to Britain's economy and society, the white paper said there had been "record levels of long-term net migration in the UK and that sheer volume has given rise to public concern." It cites pressure on housing, infrastructure, public services and downward pressure on wages for those on the lowest incomes.
"We will design our immigration system to ensure that we are able to control the numbers of people who come here from the EU," it says. "In future, therefore, the Free Movement Directive will no longer apply and the migration of EU nationals will be subject to UK law."
Pressed in the House of Commons by opposition Labour spokesman Keir Starmer, Davis said EU nationals would not be forced to leave the UK. "I am not going to be throwing people out of Britain and for him to suggest that is outrageous," he said.
Irish border: 'Aim' to keep current arrangements 
Under the terms of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, which brought an end to sectarian conflict in Northern Ireland, there is currently an open border between the north and south. Any change to this arrangement would imperil the peace process, critics have warned.
However, there are doubts that the UK could maintain an open border with an EU member state -- and the white paper acknowledges the doubts, saying only that the government "aims" to maintain the current arrangements.
Speaking last month, May said that finding a solution to the border issue would be "an important priority," adding that "nobody wants to return to the borders of the past, so we will make it a priority to deliver a practical solution as soon as we can."
Trade: 'No need to start from scratch'
The government will seek to retain a large part of the country's current trade arrangements with the EU, but emphasizes the need to boost trade with other states, citing growth in its exports to South Korea, China, Brazil and Mexico.
The paper reiterates May's recent announcement that Britain will not remain in the union's single market but will instead seek "the freest and most frictionless trade possible in goods and services between the UK and the EU."
But the document made it clear that the UK wanted to retain some parts of the present single market arrangements, saying it "makes no sense to start again from scratch" in areas where rules have existed for years.
The government will seek the freest possible trade in financial services, a key sector for Britain's economy.
Several prominent financial institutions based in London have suggested moving jobs to EU states to remain part of the single market. From within the EU, Britain has been able to provide financial services across the union under a common set of rules and regulatory authority -- access known in the sector as "passporting."
More than 5,000 UK firms use passporting to provide services to the EU, while around 8,000 European firms use the instrument to provide services to Britain, and UK-based financial institutions have lobbied the government to try to retain passporting rights.
The government hopes to seek new opportunities and reform policy in the agriculture, food and fisheries sectors, which the paper described as "currently heavily influenced by EU laws."
Security: 'Deepen security cooperation'
The government says it will continue to work with the EU in fighting terrorism and maintaining security, adding it is "uniquely placed to develop and sustain a mutually beneficial model of cooperation."
It says that the UK is "driving or co-driving" approximately half of the Europol projects against organized crime, and cites the extradition of more than 8,000 individuals accused or convicted of a criminal offense to other EU countries under the European Arrest Warrant.
It reiterates its willingness to work with EU allies over criminal matters, security and cyber security while upholding its commitments to NATO.
It also highlights that it will "seek a strong and close future relationship with the EU with focus on operational and practical cross-border cooperation."
Transition: 'No cliff-edge'
The government says it wants to deliver a smooth, orderly exit and to "avoid a disruptive cliff-edge" as Britain leaves the European Union.
The government envisages finalizing a deal within the expected two-year period after triggering Article 50, but seeks a phased transition after that, to maintain stability and give businesses and institutions time to adjust.
It does not give a timeline for how long the whole process might take, saying some elements will be phased in faster than others. But it stresses Britain will not seek an "unlimited transitional status" which would be good for neither side.

Lawyer for Putin critic believes his client has been poisoned again
Set edition preference:Set edition preference:Set edition preference:By Matthew Chance and Emma Burrows, CNNUpdated 7:11 PM ET, Thu February 2, 2017 Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.Moscow (CNN)A critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin who was in a coma in 2015 after a suspected poisoning has been hospitalized in Russia after falling ill in the early hours of Thursday, his attorney said. CNN's Steve Almasy and Marilia Brocchetto contributed to this report. Vladimir Kara-Murza has suffered "multiple organ failure," is on dialysis and is being artificially ventilated, his lawyer, Vadim Prokhorov, wrote on Facebook.
Kara-Murza, 35, is "currently in a stable but critical condition" in a hospital, Prokhorov said by phone. "It is a very, very difficult situation," he added.
Prokhorov said he doesn't believe this illness is related to Kara-Murza's previous health problems, but said he suspects it is another case of poisoning.
"None of the medical staff can explain the reason for his current condition. Both last time and once again now," he said. 
He said he has no direct proof his client was poisoned. 
US Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, said Putin should be held accountable if there is evidence the government poisoned Kara-Murza.
"Vladimir Putin does not deserve any benefit of the doubt here, given how commonplace political assassinations and poisonings have become under his regime," said Rubio, a frequent Putin critic. "I am praying that Kara-Murza's condition improves."
He urged the White House and the State Department to question Russian authorities about the case.
Kara-Murza is part of the Open Russia foundation, an organization of anti-Putin activists who call for open elections, a free press and civil rights reforms. 
Moscow denies involvement in 2015 health scare
CNN spoke to Kara-Murza in 2015, months after a mysterious illness nearly killed him.
"I fell into a coma, all of my major organs began failing, one after another. It was the kidneys first, then the lungs, the heart, the liver," he said at the time. 
He said he believed his 2015 suspected poisoning was a politically motivated attack.
"Frankly there is no other possible reason," he said. "I don't have any money dealings. I don't have any personal enemies. I didn't steal anybody's wife."
The case had parallels with the killing of former Russian agent Alexander Litvinenko in London.
A British public inquiry into that 2006 poisoning found two former Russian agents responsible for carrying out the poisoning with the radioactive isotope Polonium-210. Its final report concluded that Putin was "probably" aware of the operation.
The Russian Foreign Ministry dismissed the UK inquiry as politically motivated and the Kremlin said Russia wasn't involved.
In February 2015, a leading Russian opposition figure and friend of Kara-Murza, Boris Nemtsov, was shot to death on a bridge near the Kremlin as he walked home from a restaurant. Kara-Murza became ill four months later.

More toddlers suffer eye burns from laundry packets, study says
Set edition preference:Set edition preference:Set edition preference:By Susan Scutti, CNNUpdated 3:08 PM ET, Thu February 2, 2017 Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. (CNN)From 2012 to 2015, the number of chemical burns to the eye linked to laundry detergent packets rose more than 30 times among young children, a new study says. More than 1,200 3- and 4-year-olds received such burns in that time period, according to the research published Thursday in the medical journal JAMA Ophthalmology.  See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.Single-dose detergent packs, known as laundry packets or pods, entered the mass market in 2012.
"Each pod consists of a detergent mixture wrapped in a water-soluble film, made up of a proprietary polyvinyl alcohol polymer," said Eric J. Moorhead, president and principal scientist of Good Chemistry LLC, a consulting firm.
"The liquid detergent in the pods is not the same as regular liquid detergent. It has a higher concentration of surfactants, chemicals that are responsible for stain removal," said Moorhead, who was not involved in the new study. "At high concentrations, these ordinarily safe ingredients can cause irritation, especially in sensitive areas like the eyes."
'Among the worst chemicals'
Among kids between 3 and 4 years old, the number of chemical burns in the eye caused by laundry detergent packets increased from 12 instances in 2012 to 480 in 2015. Proportionally, the total chemical eye injuries associated with the packets increased from 0.8% of all burns in 2012 to 26% in 2015. 
Children can injure themselves when the packets break and the contents squirt into one or both eyes, or when the contents leak onto the children's hands and they rub their eyes. 
Most of these burns happened in the home, where kids are playing with the brightly colored packets, "wondering if they're toys, if they're candy," said the lead researcher, Dr. R. Sterling Haring of Johns Hopkins University. They're neither.
The detergents inside the pods "are among the worst chemicals that the eye can be exposed to," Haring said: Detergents are alkaline in nature, and alkaline burns are typically more severe than acid burns in the eye. "They penetrate deeper, they burn faster, and they are more caustic to the tissues in the eye itself."
Because the cornea doesn't have blood vessels, it doesn't heal well, so if you scar it with detergent packet chemicals, "there's a high risk of long-term vision impairment," Haring said.
"We'd done another study a few months ago that showed that small children are at highest risk for all types of chemical ocular burns, and that kind of flew in the face of conventional wisdom," he said. "They always thought that working-age men were the highest risk group: working in factories, splashing chemical in their eyes."
Instead, he and his colleagues were surprised to find that young children have a 50% higher risk than the highest-risk adult, Haring said. Once that news got out, community physicians insisted that the cause was laundry detergent packets. Haring and his team discovered that they were right. Their study concludes with recommendations that parents properly store these packets and that manufacturers consider new, redesigned packaging.
In essence, these recommendations "are already in play," said Brian Sansoni, vice president of sustainability initiatives at the American Cleaning Institute, which represents the US cleaning products industry.
He said the new study analyzed data prior to the new safety standards that were published in December 2015 by ASTM International, formerly American Society for Testing and Materials International, a non-profit that develops voluntary consensus standards for consumer manufacturers. The American Cleaning Institute helped identify proper standards for the packets.
Following publication of the safety standards, Procter & Gamble, the company that makes Gain and Tide brand laundry detergent pods, launched ad campaigns to raise awareness of the dangers and made its packaging more difficult for small children to open. Other companies also followed suit.
"Make sure you keep these products up and away from children -- like a lot of household products," said Sansoni.
What should parents do?
Dr. Michael Grosso, chairman of the department of pediatrics and chief medical officer at Northwell Health's Huntington Hospital in Huntington, New York, said parents need to worry about these laundry packets and keep them out of the way.
"It's not only eye injuries. Children will also swallow these," said Grosso, who was not involved in the study. Eye injuries caused by the packets "can be quite serious," he added.
"The majority of individuals will recover their vision after this kind of injury," he said. However, these burns can be "very, very painful. They require extensive emergency treatment and extensive follow-up treatment by an ophthalmologist."
The first thing parents should do is "prevent this by keeping these pods out of the way. They need to be kept up high in cabinets beyond the reach of a preschool child, the group that's most at risk."
If a child does get detergent in their eye, a parent should immediately irrigate the child's eyes.
"Cool tap water, as much as possible, as soon as possible," Grosso said. "And then the very next step would be a trip to the emergency department."
Haring echoed this advice. "Take your child and put their eye under cool water under the faucet and flush it with cool water for 20 minutes," he said, noting that if the burn is extremely severe, some loss of vision could occur.
"Don't stop and take them to the hospital. Don't call and wait for an ambulance to show up. Flush the eye with cool water before you do anything else," Haring said. "That's going to be the deciding factor about long-term outcome for this injury."

Treasury allowing for some transactions with Russian intelligence agency
By Kevin Liptak, CNN White House ProducerUpdated 2:51 PM ET, Thu February 2, 2017 Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. (CNN)The Treasury Department said Thursday it will allow for some companies to do limited business with Russia's Federal Security Service, known as the FSB.  The move is a minor easing of a sanction put in place at the end of the Obama administration that limits business to $5,000 for any calendar year.
A top State Department official said the move was made as a technical fix to the sanctions that were put in place to avoid "unintended consequences" of US government business with Russia. 
President Donald Trump denied Thursday he'd eased sanctions on Russia.
"I haven't eased anything," Trump said during a meeting with Harley-Davidson executives at the White House.
White House press secretary Sean Spicer said the same during his daily press briefing.
"From what I understand it's a fairly common practice for the Treasury Department, after sanctions are in place, to go back and look at whether or not there needs to be specific carve-outs for different industries or products or services," he said.
He said the move didn't reflect a shift in policy, but rather a "regular course of action."
The fix was in the works soon after the sanctions were put in place because FSB is also involved in customs and border checks on trade. The sanctions had the unintended consequence of preventing US businesses from being able to pay some necessary trade-related costs to the Russian government.
US intelligence agencies accused the FSB of being involved in the election-related hacking last year.
The Treasury Department did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment.
