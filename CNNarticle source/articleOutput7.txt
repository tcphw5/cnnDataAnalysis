French far-right leader Le Pen applauds Trump's travel ban
Set edition preference:Set edition preference:Set edition preference:By Angela Dewan, CNNUpdated 11:28 AM ET, Wed February 1, 2017 Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. (CNN)The leader of France's far-right Front National party, Marine Le Pen, has applauded US President Donald Trump's controversial travel ban and said a backlash to the measure was in "bad faith."He was elected and he said that he was going to do this. And now the world seems to be scandalized because he's implementing what he promised he would do during his campaign.Marine Le PenWatch the interview with Marine Le Pen on CNN International's Amanpour at 2pm ET.
Trump signed an executive order Friday barring citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States for the next 90 days and suspending the admission of all refugees for 120 days. The order also indefinitely suspends the Syrian refugee program.
Dubbed a "Muslim ban" by many, the order has been condemned by the countries affected and Western European leaders. 
"I think that most of the reactions are in bad faith," Le Pen, who is expected to be a frontrunner in France's presidential elections in April and May, told CNN's Christiane Amanpour.
"It is a temporary measure. It targets six or seven countries, countries that of course are responsible for terrorist threats.
"So I think Donald Trump and his intelligence services wanted to set up criteria and conditions to avoid having potential terrorists enter the United States, where they might commit attacks, the same way that France was the victim of attacks," she said, pointing out that many Muslim-majority countries have a permanent travel ban against Israeli citizens. 
When asked whether she would impose a similar ban in France, she avoided answering directly, saying only that France had to be "very vigilant" and to secure its borders.
"France no longer has any borders because of the EU," Le Pen said.
'Wild and anarchic globalization'
Le Pen said the flurry of executive orders signed in Trump's first days in office, which include cutting funds to aid programs to erecting a wall along the US-Mexican border, did not surprise her.
"He was elected and he said that he was going to do this. And now the world seems to be scandalized because he's implementing what he promised he would do during his campaign," she said.
Le Pen is basking in major geopolitical shifts in the world, seeing Trump's rise and Britain's vote to leave the European Union as a boon to her presidential campaign, which she has fought on an anti-immigration platform. 
She called for a stop to the flow of immigrants coming into France, but said she was not interested in mirroring Trump's wall to protect French borders.
While she said she did not look for models abroad, Le Pen supported Trump's anti-free-trade policies, saying that "unfettered free trade has led to a disaster." 
"I see that these ideas are now being put into implementation by the British, following the referendum, and I think following the election of Donald Trump that people are also calling for an end to this wild and anarchic globalization, and that we are moving towards greater patriotism, to the preservation of culture, of local jobs," she said.
Frexit?
The party leader repeated a promise to hold a referendum on leaving the European Union within six months if she were elected president. She said she would first try and strike a deal to return territorial, economic and legal sovereignty to France, and failing that, she would let the French people vote on whether they wanted to remain in the regional bloc.
On Tuesday, Le Pen locked horns with the European Parliament, missing a deadline for repaying 300,000 euros that the Parliament says she misused. 
The party leader denied the allegations in the interview and characterized the issue as a "political attack." She said she would refuse to pay back the money.
"It's inadmissible. We have been persecuted by the EU Parliament. They are our adversaries," she said, adding that she had filed a complaint against the European Anti-Fraud Office.
Russia sanctions 'completely stupid'
Le Pen, a long-time supporter of Russian President Vladimir Putin, also said that she did not believe Russia had "invaded" Crimea and slammed the sanctions slapped on the country.
"These sanctions are completely stupid. They have not solved any problems, they haven't improved the situation at all. All they've done is create major economic problems for the EU," she said, adding that the world would achieve some peace with a "step back from the Cold War."

Whither Melania Trump? 12 days without a public sighting
By Kate Bennett and Betsy Klein, CNNUpdated 10:17 PM ET, Wed February 1, 2017 Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.Washington (CNN)The West Wing has been churning out news non-stop since President Donald Trump took office, but the East Wing has quite literally remained dark. CNN's Noah Gray contributed to this report.It's been 12 days since the last public sighting of first lady Melania Trump, who had been planning on splitting her time between Washington and New York, where the couple's son, Barron, is completing the school year.
And when a solemn scene unfolded Wednesday afternoon as Trump boarded Marine One to pay his respects to a fallen service member's family in Delaware, he was accompanied by first daughter, Ivanka -- a reminder that she is his closest family in Washington.
Melania Trump's last public appearance was on January 21, when she went to the post-inauguration multi-faith prayer service at Washington's National Cathedral. The next day, which coincided with the couple's 12th wedding anniversary, Melania Trump returned to New York City, Barron in tow. 
A spokeswoman for the first lady told CNN Trump would be returning to Trump Tower -- temporarily. 
"The first lady thanks everyone for their support and a beautiful welcome to Washington. She is returning to New York in advance of the school week and will be splitting her time between Washington and New York for the next few weeks," the spokeswoman said. 
She has not been back to DC since.
Despite this, a spokeswoman for the first lady knocked down recent reports that the Melania Trump would not be moving to Washington at all.
"That report is not true," the spokeswoman said. 
Later Wednesday, Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, acting as senior adviser to the first lady, confirmed Melania Trump will move to Washington.
"Mrs. Trump will be moving to DC and settling in to the White House at the end of the school year, splitting her time between New York and DC in the meantime," she said. "Mrs. Trump is honored to serve this country and is taking the role and responsibilities of first lady very seriously. It has only been a short time since the inauguration and the first lady is going to go about her role in a pragmatic and thoughtful way that is unique and authentic to her." 
But for now, without a full-time first lady, the typical duties of that part of the White House machine are at a veritable standstill. On Wednesday evening, the first lady's office shifted into a more active gear, announcing the hiring of Lindsay Reynolds, a former associate director of the White House Visitor's Office during the George W. Bush administration, to be Trump's chief of staff.
"I am putting together a professional and highly-experienced team which will take time to do properly. I am excited to be organizing and bringing together such a dynamic and forward thinking group of individuals who will work together to make our country better for everyone," Trump said in a statement.
But the first lady largely hasn't filled out a staff, including a communications director and social secretary.
Trump also hasn't formally announced a platform of official causes, a social schedule of events, nor her Washington calendar. 
On Monday night, paparazzi caught the first lady and Barron "running errands" in New York City. Melania Trump, in a cream-colored coat and signature five-inch high heels, and Barron, were ferried around Manhattan by a Secret Service detail. 
During the transition, the President told reporters said his wife and youngest son would join him "very soon. Right after he finishes school."
And in an interview with New York Times last week, Trump said that Melania and Barron, 10, would be at the White House on weekends.
The White House declined a CNN request for comment on the first lady's whereabouts. But sources inside Pennsylvania Avenue said Melania Trump hasn't been seen at the White House since inaugural weekend. 
She is expected to join her husband at Mar-a-Lago this weekend, a White House official confirmed Wednesday. 
Also missing? The first lady's staff. 
With spots open for at least 20-30 East Wing positions -- from the social office to the communications team and public outreach -- there have been zero officials hires.
Melania Trump has been actively been conducting interviews for staffing posts over the past several weeks, though, and some names have been floated. 
Melania Trump made few public appearances on the campaign trail. She did deliver a high-profile speech at the Republican National Convention in August, a performance quickly enveloped in controversy when it was discovered she plagiarized part of her speech from Michelle Obama. 
But her speech also provided a rare insight into her relationship with the President: "He is tough when he has to be, but he is also kind and fair and caring. This kindness is not always noted, but it is there for all to see. That is one reason I fell in love with him to begin with," she had said in Cleveland. 
She also defended her husband to CNN's Anderson Cooper when the Access Hollywood tapes were released, calling it "boy talk."
"I said to my husband that, you know, the language was inappropriate. It's not acceptable. And I was surprised, because that is not the man that I know," she said in October. "I accept his apology. I hope the American people will accept it as well. And it was many, many years ago. He's not the man that I know."

Killer fruit? Lychee cause of mysterious disease that plagued Indian town
Set edition preference:Set edition preference:Set edition preference:By Juliet PerryUpdated 9:51 AM ET, Wed February 1, 2017 Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. (CNN)Every year since 1995, a mystery illness has plagued the town of Muzaffarpur in Bihar, India.See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.Around May and June each year, large numbers of young children would start showing signs of fever. They'd have seizures and convulsions, before slipping in and out of consciousness. 
In 2014, hundreds of children were admitted to hospital exhibiting symptoms of this illness, branded locally as "chamki ki bimari," or "tinsel disease." Of 390 admitted for treatment, 122 died. 
Teams of researchers and medical experts searched exhaustively to find the cause, but to no avail. Until now.
A new report, published in The Lancet Global Health medical journal on Tuesday, claims to have discovered what's behind the devastating disease: the unassuming lychee, otherwise known as litchi.
Heat, humidity, malnourishment, the monsoon and pesticides have all been considered at one stage to be contributing factors to the illness -- said to resemble encephalitis symptomatically, a disease that causes inflammation of the brain.
Killer fruit?
Researchers from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and India's National Centre for Disease Control compared test results of children who had developed the mysterious illness, and children who had not.
Analysis of blood and spinal fluid samples showed no signs of infection or exposure to chemicals and insecticides. 
However, most of the children who had fallen ill had eaten lychee fruit recently. They were also six times more likely to have visited a fruit orchard in the last 24 hours, the study said.
Muzaffarpur, Bihar, is the largest lychee farming region in India. 
According to the study, parents reported that children in the affected villages spent most of the day eating lychees from the surrounding orchards, often returning home in the evening "uninterested in eating a meal." 
The results said that children who fell ill were twice as likely to have skipped dinner, which, according to the researchers probably resulted in "night-time hypoglycaemia."
When their blood sugar level dropped, the body would start to metabolize fatty acids to produce a necessary boost of glucose. 
However, urine samples showed that two-thirds of the ill children showed evidence of exposure to toxins found in lychee seeds -- found in higher levels in unripe fruits. 
In the presence of these toxins "glucose synthesis is severely impaired," the study said, leading to dangerously low blood sugar and brain inflammation in the children.
'Unidentified genetic differences'
The Indian government issued a statement Wednesday advising children to henceforth "minimize litchi fruit consumption" in affected areas, and eat an evening meal during the "outbreak period."
However, the researchers said there are still some questions surrounding the mystery. For example, while orchards surround many villages in the area, typically only one child in each village develops the illness. The report suggests it may be something to do with genetics. 
"The synergistic combination of litchi consumption, a missed evening meal, and other potential factors such as poor nutritional status, eating a greater number of litchis, and as yet unidentified genetic differences might be needed to produce this illness," the study said.
However, it added that similar outbreaks had been reported in another lychee cultivation areas in West Bengal, and also beyond India in parts of Vietnam and Bangladesh. 
Previous research had focused on pesticides rather than the fruit itself, but "the findings of our investigations might help to shed light on the cause of illness in the Bangladesh and Vietnam outbreaks," the study said.

Magic bullets: US Army pursues 'biodegradable' ammunition
Set edition preference:Set edition preference:Set edition preference:By Kieron Monks, CNNUpdated 5:39 AM ET, Wed February 1, 2017 Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. (CNN)The traditional function of bullets is killing, but a new design could have the opposite effect. The US army is seeking proposals for biodegradable ammunition to replace the existing rounds used in training -- including grenade and tank rounds - citing environmental concerns. 
"Components of current training rounds require hundreds of years or more to biodegrade," states the Department of Defense brief. "Some of these rounds might have the potential to corrode and pollute the soil and nearby water."
The DoD stipulates that the new ammunition should, instead, contain seeds that produce food for animals: "This effort will make use of seeds to grow environmentally friendly plants that remove soil contaminants and consume the biodegradable components developed under this project. Animals should be able to consume the plants without any ill effects."
This eye-catching proposal may seem far-fetched, but the brief goes on to claim that US army researchers have already succeeded in embedding seeds into biodegradable material to flower months later. 
Ripe targets 
Military facilities account for 900 of the 1300 most polluted sites in the US, according to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). A comprehensive clean-up could cost $165 billion, according to the DoD.   
Much of the damage is historic, pre-dating awareness of environmental issues. 
"(Military bases) tend to have older buildings with lead paint and asbestos problems," says Skip Kazmarek, an environmental lawyer who has studied military sites. "If a base was operating in World War Two it might have burn pits for waste oil and solvents, and it can be a pretty nasty area."
But modern sites also generate toxic waste; from burning explosives to chemical leaks and heavy metal deposits -- including massive lead pollution.
Lead poisoning can cause serious health conditions including brain damage, as well as polluting the environment. Millions of lead bullets are fired each year on military firing ranges, which rapidly reach high levels of contamination according to an Environmental Working Group report. 
"The lead in ammunition tends to build up over years and it can leach into groundwater and pose threats to wildlife," says Kazmarek. "You could improve environmental quality with a change from lead bullets."  
The future's green?
Efforts to produce sustainable ammunition are intensifying, and producing a series of innovations. 
The US army has experimented with tungsten bullets, but reverted to lead over health risks. Canada recently unveiled a new "green" bullet designed to reduce contamination.  
"This idea of reducing toxic metal poisoning has been gaining traction for the past 25 years," says Nic Jenzen-Jones, director of the Armament Research Services. "Particularly over the last 10 years there has been a push towards assessing the projectiles of different weapon systems to see if they can be made less harmful to users and the environment."
Western militaries are scaling up research and development of ammunition with a neutral or positive environmental impact, says Jenzen-Jones, citing the progress of Norwegian company Nammo in producing lead-free bullets that have been adopted by the Swedish army. 
There are hurdles to overcome -- such as cost, performance and compatibility with existing equipment -- but the arms expert believes that sustainability has become a priority. 
"Militaries understand the cost trade-off of going green (and) they are happy to spend a little more to receive the environmental benefits," says Jenzen-Jones. He points to the DoD's increasing role in conservation and species protection as a sign of intent. 
Military practices could follow the example of sport shooting, which has pioneered sustainable ammunition. Nations such as Denmark have banned lead bullets for hunting, and former President Obama made one of his final commands a crackdown on their use in wildlife refuges. 
Hunters are also leading civil society campaigns against lead pollution. 
The edible grenades may be some time in arriving, but the US army appears ready to do battle with its toxic footprint.

Republicans suspend committee rules, advance Mnuchin, Price nominations
By MJ Lee, CNN National Politics ReporterUpdated 12:08 PM ET, Wed February 1, 2017 Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. (CNN)Senate Republicans took an extraordinary step Wednesday to move forward with two of President Donald Trump's top Cabinet nominees after confronting a boycott from Democrats.Republican lawmakers on the Senate Finance Committee -- the panel that oversees the nominations of Steve Mnuchin to be Treasury secretary and Rep. Tom Price to be secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services -- gathered for the second day in a row with Democrats on the committee refusing to show up. 
The dramatic move could foreshadow strategy from Republicans over contentious battles still to come as Democrats try to use a variety of Senate procedures to stall the newly empowered GOP. The most high-profile of upcoming fights is Trump's Supreme Court pick Neil Gorsuch, a nomination that would require at least 60 votes to break a filibuster. 
Under committee rules, it is required that at least one Democrat be present for the panel to vote to send a nominee to the Senate floor. On Tuesday, not a single Democrat showed up, putting the two nominations at a standstill. 
Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, a Utah Republican, pointed to the "extraordinary circumstances" surrounding the gathering and allowed the Republicans in the room vote to suspend the rules of the committee. 
With the committee rules suspended, the 14 Republicans in the room voted to move the Mnuchin and Price nominations to the full Senate, even without the presence of a single member of the opposite party. 
"They on their own accord refused to participate in the exercise," Hatch said about the Democrats on the committee. "They have nobody to blame but themselves."
Hatch said the Senate Parliamentarian had approved of the procedural maneuver, and insisted to reporters after the exercise was a "just utilization" of the rules. "This is all approved by the Parliamentarian," he said. "I wouldn't have done it if it hadn't been."
Democrats on the Finance Committee have raised serious concerns about both Price and Mnuchin, arguing that the two nominees made misrepresentations in their testimonies before the Senate. 
Earlier on Wednesday, the Democrats on the panel sent a letter to Hatch requesting that the two nominees provide more information about their past investments and actions.  
The committee's call for a 9:30 a.m. gathering was so sudden that even some members of the media scrambled to arrive at the hearing room in the Dirksen building on time. 
Hatch chuckled when confronted by questions from reporters about the little notice that the public received about Wednesday s meeting. "You were scrambling? Well, you know, that's neither here nor there," he said. 
The chairman also said that he had not yet spoken with the committee's top Democrat, Sen. Ron Wyden, Wednesday morning. "I don't feel a bit sorry for them," Hatch said.  
In a statement, Wyden called Wednesday's development "deeply troubling."
"Today, for the first time in history, the Senate Finance Committee broke the rules to push through on a partisan basis two nominees," Wyden said. "Congressman Tom Price, whose stock trades call into question whether he will work in the public interest or his own, and the other, Steven Mnuchin, who appears to have misled the committee on his company's foreclosure practices after the Great Recession."
Democrats asked that Price offer clarify on "inaccurate and misleading answer to questions about privileged and discounted access to stocks," and wanted Mnuchin to address "inaccurate and misleading answer to questions about the potentially illegal process known as robo-signing," among other things.
But with the two nominations already having been sent to the full Senate, Republicans are unlikely to cooperate. 
"I don't care what they want at this point," Hatch said.

White House national security adviser: Iran is 'on notice'
By Kevin Liptak, Jeremy Diamond and Brad Lendon, CNNUpdated 2:04 AM ET, Thu February 2, 2017 Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump's National Security Advisor Michael Flynn condemned Wednesday Iran's recent ballistic missile test launch, calling it a "provocative" breach of a UN Security Council resolution.Flynn called the launch the latest in a series of provocative moves by Iran that have included backing Houthi rebels in Yemen, who have attacked US allies.
"As of today, we are officially putting Iran on notice," Flynn said from the White House briefing room.
Flynn did not say whether the US would take action beyond a verbal warning, and three senior administration officials, speaking on background, said Wednesday that they are still in the early stages of determining what action the US should take in response.
"We are considering a whole range of options. We're in a deliberative process," one of the officials said.
Those options include financial measures and economic sanctions, and the officials said the administration would not take any options off the table, including a military response. They also stressed that a violation of the UN Security Council Resolution on Iranian ballistic missile activity would not impact the Iran nuclear deal.
One of the officials said Flynn's warning on Wednesday delivered from the White House -- one that might typically be issued by diplomats -- was intended to reflect "the level of importance that this administration believes this issue warrants."
'Provocative'
Iran's Foreign Ministry insisted Tuesday that Sunday's missile test was "solely for defensive purposes," and not a violation of the UN Security Council resolution which bars Iran from testing "ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons." 
President Barack Obama's administration one year ago enacted financial sanctions on 11 people and companies involved in Iran's ballistic missile program after the country conducted two test launches of ballistic missiles.
That came after the UN determined in late 2015 that those launches were in violation of the Security Council resolution. The UN Security Council Resolution is not part of the Iran nuclear deal, but a separate security council measure.
Flynn did not signal whether the US would take any concrete actions -- military or diplomatic -- to counter what he described as "provocative" Iranian actions, but he did criticize the Obama administration for having "failed to respond adequately to Iran's maligned actions."
Flynn added that Iran's actions threaten stability in the region and place American lives at risk, and said Iran was "on notice." 
"The Trump administration condemns such actions by Iran that undermine security, prosperity and stability throughout and beyond the Middle East and place American lives at risk," he said.
White House press secretary Sean Spicer added Wednesday that the US won't "sit by and not act on those actions."
Flynn's warning comes as forces from the US, British, French and Australian navies engage in exercises in the Persian Gulf.
A total of 17 warships from the four nations are participating in the exercises, named Unified Trident, led by the UK's amphibious assault ship HMS Ocean, according to a US Navy press release.
The drills are designed to "ensure the free flow of commerce" through waterways of strategic interest to the entire world, the US Navy release said.
The commander of Iran's navy, Rear Adm. Habibollah Sayyari, warned the four navies not enter Iran's territorial waters, according to a report from state-owned Press TV.
Iran's Defense Minister Brig. Gen. Hossein Dehghan referenced the new US administration in telling Iran's independent Mehr News Agency the allied exercise would not be successful.
"Under the situation created in the wake of the presidency of Donald Trump, Persian Gulf littoral states are somehow concerned about the future and the European countries are interested in cementing their presence in the region and giving some form of reassurance to their allies," Dehghan is quoted as saying.
"These drills will have no outcome for them," Dehghan said.
Tensions have been on edge around the Persian Gulf this year. In early January, the US guided-missile destroyer USS Mahan fired warning shots at Iranian boats near the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow entrance to the Persian Gulf.
The five Iranian boats came "within 900 yards or so" of the Mahan, which was sailing with two other US ships, a Pentagon spokesman said at the time.
A US warship also fired warning shots at Iranian vessels in an incident last August.

Trump trip canceled; Harley-Davidson wasn't comfortable with likely protests, per source
By Jeremy Diamond, CNNUpdated 7:21 PM ET, Tue January 31, 2017 Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump will not head to Milwaukee for a previously scheduled visit of a Harley-Davidson factory after the company decided it wasn't comfortable hosting him amid planned protests, an administration official said Tuesday.This story has been updated to reflect additional reporting.Trump had been scheduled to tour the factory Thursday where he also planned to sign executive orders related to American manufacturing.
The visit had not been publicly announced, but White House staffers were already on the ground in Milwaukee setting up for Trump's planned visit to the factory on Thursday.
White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham confirmed Trump is not expected to go to Milwaukee on Thursday.
Harley-Davidson issued a statement Tuesday night saying they "don't have, nor did we have, a scheduled visit from the President this week at any of our facilities." 
"We are proud to have hosted Presidential visits at our facilities. Three of the last five presidents -- Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton -- have visited us at our facilities. These visits are a testament to the pride and passion of our employees and their great work building Harley-Davidson motorcycles," said Maripat Blankenheim, director of Harley-Davidson's corporate communication. "We look forward to hosting the president in the future."
Trump set to make Supreme Court pick
Large protests have been in the works in recent days, particularly in light of Trump's executive order issuing an immigration ban.
It was the threat of protests, and not Trump's planned signing of executive orders, that made Harley-Davidson uncomfortable, the official said.
The canceled trip highlighted the difficulties Trump will continue to face as he looks to implement his agenda while his presidency is engulfed in controversy.
Trump's decision to temporarily ban citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from traveling to the US and suspend the admission of all refugees has sparked a wave of protests nationwide -- protests which now appear to have torpedoed the rollout of an unrelated part of his policy agenda.
The travel ban was also met with widespread condemnation by Democrats and even some Republicans who called the move counterproductive to US counterterrorism efforts.
That fiery opposition has already ramped up Democrats' efforts to stall the confirmation of Trump's Cabinet nominees, and could also trickle down to legislative efforts.
